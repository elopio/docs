<p><a href="https://app.augur.net">Augur</a> is a decentralized prediction market platform that runs on Ethereum.</p>

<p>The stable Augur application is built and hosted at <a href="https://app.augur.net">https://app.augur.net</a>. If you want to use or help test Augur, you do not need to download or install anything! Just go to <a href="https://app.augur.net">https://app.augur.net</a> and start using it. (If you want to use our cutting-edge development client, this is maintained at <a href="https://dev.augur.net">https://dev.augur.net</a> &ndash; warning, we push changes to augur-dev.firebaseapp.com pretty rapidly, so it can be a bit buggy! We suggest simply using <a href="https://app.augur.net">https://app.augur.net</a> for a more stable experience.)</p>

<p>Augur has its own dedicated Stack Exchange which can be found at <a href="https://augur.stackexchange.com/">augur.stackexchange.com</a>. The Stack Exchange allows people to ask questions about Augur and get answers to those questions. It&rsquo;s a great resource to find the answers for questions you might have that aren&rsquo;t answered directly in these documents. Additionally, you can chat with us on <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>. If you&rsquo;d like to join the conversation, just go to <a href="http://invite.augur.net">invite.augur.net</a> and sign up. Most questions are best asked in the <code class="prettyprint">#dev</code> or <code class="prettyprint">#general</code> channels.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you would like to help develop Augur, you&rsquo;ll need to build the client from source. To do this, first install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, and <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>.</p>

<p>Next, clone the <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur">Augur repository</a> from Github by opening a terminal window and typing:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ git clone https://github.com/AugurProject/augur.git</code></p>

<p>Navigate to the newly created <code class="prettyprint">augur</code> folder by running:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ cd augur</code></p>

<p>Once this has been done, Augur&rsquo;s dependencies will need to be installed. This can be done using either <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> or <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>. Both methods are detailed in the next sections.</p>

<p>If you plan on submitting a pull request to the Augur Project, please be sure to read through the <a href="#contributing">Contributing</a> section of these documents before submitting the request.</p>

<aside class="notice"><b>If you are using or helping to develop the Augur client (i.e., the front-end/user interface), it usually is not necessary for you to run a local Ethereum node on your computer.</b> We&rsquo;re already running several <a href="#hosted-node">hosted nodes</a> to which you can connect! If you are running an Ethereum node, the client will automatically detect it and begin talking to it; if you are not, the client will default to using the hosted nodes.</aside>

<h2 id="using-npm">Using NPM</h2>

<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> comes with a built in package manager called <code class="prettyprint">npm</code>. <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> is used to install dependencies for Augur, build the Augur project from source code, run <a href="#tests">tests</a>, and start a web server to host Augur, among other things. To install Augur&rsquo;s dependencies using <code class="prettyprint">npm</code>, run the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm install</code></p>

<p>To build Augur from the source code, run:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm run build</code></p>

<p>After building Augur from the source files, a local web server will need to be started. This can be done using the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm start</code></p>

<p>To enable hot-reloading (which automatically loads changes made locally), run the following instead of <code class="prettyprint">npm start</code>:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm run dev</code></p>

<p>Doing this is an easy way to do some hacking on the Augur source code and see the changes reflected in real time.</p>

<p>Now open a web browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>. This should load Augur&rsquo;s most popular categories page. </p>

<p>Congratulations, you&rsquo;re ready to start hacking!</p>

<h2 id="using-yarn">Using Yarn</h2>

<p>Some people prefer to use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">yarn</a> instead of <code class="prettyprint">npm</code>. To use yarn, execute the following command to install the Augur dependencies:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn</code></p>

<p>To build Augur from the source code, run:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn build</code></p>

<p>After building, the following command will start a local web server:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn start</code></p>

<p>To enable hot-reloading for development purposes, run the following instead of <code class="prettyprint">yarn start</code>:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn dev</code></p>

<p>Finally, open a web browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>. This should load Augur&rsquo;s most popular categories page.  </p>

<p>Congratulations, you&rsquo;re ready to start hacking!</p>

          <h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<aside class="notice">The Architecture section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don&rsquo;t worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>

<p>Augur is designed to work with a locally-running Ethereum node; however, if one is not available, Augur can be configured to use a hosted Ethereum node instead. A hosted Ethereum node is one that is hosted on a public server by the Augur team. The sections below explain a bit about each setup and provide a diagram of what&rsquo;s going on under the hood.</p>

<h2 id="local-ethereum-node">Local Ethereum Node</h2>

<p>Running a local Ethereum node, such as <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum">Geth</a>, while using Augur provides the best performance and overall experience. This is because Augur sends RPC requests to a hosted Ethereum node takes more time than sending them to a local node. To use a local Ethereum node with Augur, either download and run the Augur app locally, or simply visit <a href="https://app.augur.net">https://app.augur.net</a>, which is configured to automatically talk to a local node, if present.</p>

<p><img src="images/architecture_local.svg" onerror="this.src='images/architecture_local.png'"></p>

<aside class="notice">To use sendTransaction RPC commands (or any other command that requires Ether or is actually sent to the Ethereum network) the Ethereum node will need to unlocked. The easiest way to do this using Geth is to start it using the <code>--unlock</code> option:

<code class="block">geth --unlock 0 --testnet --rpc --ws --rpccorsdomain "http://localhost:8080" --wsorigins "http://localhost:8080"</code>

The <code>--ws</code> flag allows websocket connections, which are recommended for speed.  The <code>--rpccorsdomain</code> and <code>--wsorigins</code> flags specify what domains are allowed to send RPC requests to your geth node. Here <code>http://localhost:8080</code> is whitelisted; this is the default address where the <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur">Augur client</a> is served, if you build Augur locally. To use your local Ethereum node with a remote (hosted) Augur client, you will need to set <code>--rpccorsdomain</code> and/or <code>--wsorigins</code> to your host&rsquo;s address; for example, if the remote host is at <code>http://app.augur.net</code>, then you would use <code>http://app.augur.net</code> for <code>--rpccorsdomain</code> and <code>--wsorigins</code>.</aside>

<p><strong>Note to Geth users:</strong> Geth&rsquo;s RPC server uses regular (unencrypted) HTTP and because of this, in order for the Augur app to communicate with your local Geth node, it must be served over HTTP.</p>

<h2 id="hosted-ethereum-node">Hosted Ethereum Node</h2>

<p>Since many users do not wish to go to the trouble of running a full Ethereum node solely for the purpose of using Augur, Augur maintains a public (testnet during the beta) Ethereum node at <a href="https://eth9000.augur.net">https://eth9000.augur.net</a>, which is used automatically by <a href="https://app.augur.net">https://app.augur.net</a> (and by <a href="http://local.augur.net">local.augur.net</a> if a local Ethereum node is not detected).</p>

<p><img src="images/architecture_hosted.svg" onerror="this.src='images/architecture_hosted.png'"></p>

          <h1 id="trading">Trading</h1>

<aside class="notice">The Trading section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don&rsquo;t worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>

<p>Augur allows anyone to create an openly tradable <a href="#market">Market</a> about any upcoming event. Augur will maintain an <a href="#order-book">Order Book</a> for each of the markets created. Any trader can place or take an <a href="#order">Order</a> on the Market&rsquo;s Order Book. When placing an trade, if there is an Order on the book that will fulfill your trade request then it will be <a href="#fill-order">Filled</a> immediately. If there is no matching Order, or your trade request can only be partially Filled, the remainder of what wasn&rsquo;t filled of your trade will be placed on the Order Book as an Order. If you are the <a href="#order-creator">Creator</a> of the Order you can cancel it to remove it from the Order Book. Orders are executed on a &ldquo;first come, first served&rdquo; basis.</p>

<p>The Augur UI will offer users the best prices first when displaying the Order Book on each Market page. Orders are never executed at a worse price than the limit price set by the trader, however they can settle for better than the limit price. Orders can also be partially filled. The UI will automatically include multiple backup/fallback Orders to attempt to fill our Order in the event that the best Order was filled before we sent the transaction. These backup/fallback Orders will always fit within the limit price set by the trader.</p>

<h2 id="trading-example">Trading Example</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use an example <a href="#binary-market">Binary Market</a> trading on the &ldquo;super big event&rdquo; coming up. For this example, we want to go long on <code class="prettyprint">Outcome A</code>. We would submit a trade request to buy <code class="prettyprint">100</code> <a href="#shares">Shares</a> of <code class="prettyprint">Outcome A</code> with a limit price of <code class="prettyprint">0.5 ETH</code>, which will cost <code class="prettyprint">50.0 ETH</code> plus GAS used to send the transaction.</p>

<p>If there are Orders on the Order Book that match our request for <code class="prettyprint">100</code> Shares of <code class="prettyprint">Outcome A</code> at a price of <code class="prettyprint">0.5 ETH</code>, or cheaper, then Augur will fill those Orders. We will now own <code class="prettyprint">100</code> Shares of <code class="prettyprint">Outcome A</code> and we will have lost <code class="prettyprint">50.0 ETH</code> plus GAS cost.</p>

<p>If no Order is available on the Order Book that would partially or completely fill our trade request then a <a href="#bid-order">Bid Order</a> would be placed on the Order Book. Whenever an Order is placed on the Order Book something of value is escrowed by the Market. In our example, the value we are giving to the Market to place our bid would be our <code class="prettyprint">50.0 ETH</code>. If we were attempting to sell Shares that we currently owned then we would escrow the Shares instead of <code class="prettyprint">ETH</code>. If we cancel our Order we can get our <code class="prettyprint">50.0 ETH</code> back, the only currency lost would be the GAS used to pay to place the trade and cancel the trade. When a <a href="#order-filler">Filler</a> decides to fill our Order on the Order Book, we will get our <code class="prettyprint">100</code> shares of <code class="prettyprint">Outcome A</code> transferred to us.</p>

<p>For more information on how to trade using the Augur API, check the <a href="#trade-tx-api">trade</a> section of the <a href="#transaction-api">Transaction API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="settlement-fees-explained">Settlement Fees Explained</h2>

<p>Creating a Market costs a small amount of <code class="prettyprint">ETH</code>. Without some incentive people won&rsquo;t create Markets as they get nothing in return for the <code class="prettyprint">ETH</code> they spent to create it. Augur solves this problem by allowing <a href="#market-creator">Market Creators</a> to set a <a href="#creator-fee">Creator Fee</a> for their Market. The Creator Fee must be between <code class="prettyprint">0</code> and <code class="prettyprint">50</code> percent. Once a Market is created the Creator Fee cannot be raised, only lowered.</p>

<p>Augur also extracts Fees to help support the <a href="#reporting">Reporting System</a> known as the <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fee</a>. <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a> refer to both the Creator Fee and the Reporting Fee combined. The Reporting Fee isn&rsquo;t set by the Market Creator, like the Creator Fee, but is instead set by an automated Augur Market.</p>

<p>Augur will automatically create a Market once every Thirty (30) days to use as a data feed for the <a href="#rep">REP</a> price. This Market will act just like a regular Market and it will go through <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a> process in order to be <a href="#market-resolution">Resolved</a>. Once the REP price is known, Augur can calculate the REP Market cap and the appropriate Reporting Fee to ensure the security of the Reporting System.</p>

<p>The Augur contracts will track the open interest of all Markets passively as people interact with Augur, which allows Augur to always have access to the open interest numbers. Once the open interest and REP market caps are known Augur can then determine wether the Reporting Fee is too high or too low. Augur then calculates the new Reporter Fee using the following formula:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">current_reporting_fee * (augur_open_interest * 5 / rep_market_cap)</code></p>

<p>The Reporting Fee will be updated once every 30 days, or once every <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. If updates where to occur too frequently, the market will not have time to adjust to the new fees. If we update too infrequently, then we are at risk of the security model becoming invalid due to a sudden growth in Augur that isn&rsquo;t yet accounted for by the fee system.</p>

<p>Settlement Fees are extracted anytime <a href="#settlement">Settlement</a> occurs and Shares are destroyed. This can happen for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selling a <a href="#complete-set">Complete Set</a></li>
<li>Redeeming shares for the finalized outcome in a <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized Market</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Selling a Complete Set can be thought of as exiting your market <a href="#position">Position</a>. Complete Sets are a set of Shares for each <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a>. Complete Sets are priced differently for each Market, and are determined by the <a href="#number-of-ticks">Number of Ticks</a>, which represents all possible price points, or <a href="#tick">Ticks</a>, for a Market as well as the amount of attoeth it costs to purchase a Complete Set for the Market. If you own a set of Shares in each Outcome, you can Settle those Shares and receive <code class="prettyprint">ETH</code> back for their value minus Settlement Fees.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-trades">Calculating Trades</h2>

<p>In this section we break down all potential trade situations and their expected result. There are two types of <a href="#order">Orders</a>, <a href="#bid-order">Bid Orders</a> (requesting to buy) and <a href="#ask-order">Ask Orders</a> (requesting to sell). In our examples below we will go over all the potential trade possibilities around Bid Orders and Ask Orders. Orders are placed on the <a href="#order-book">Order Book</a> by <a href="#order-creator">Order Creators</a> and contain four important details: The Creator of the Order, the price of the Order, The amount of <a href="#shares">Shares</a> or ETH escrowed, and the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> we plan to trade on. The price can be any value between 0 and the <a href="#number-of-ticks">Number of Ticks</a>. The calculations below use <code class="prettyprint">num_shares</code> as the number of Shares the Order is requesting, <code class="prettyprint">price</code> as the price per Share for the Order, <code class="prettyprint">outcome</code> for the Outcome our Order is trading on, <code class="prettyprint">num_ticks</code> as the Number of Ticks, and <code class="prettyprint">fee_rate</code> as the <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a> extracted during the <a href="#settlement">Settlement</a> of Shares.</p>

<p>The Formulas for determining how much opening a Long or Short position costs are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Cost of Opening a Long Position</strong>(<code class="prettyprint">open_long_position_cost</code>):</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">num_shares * price</code></p>

<p><strong>Cost of Opening a Short Position</strong>(<code class="prettyprint">open_short_position_cost</code>):</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">num_shares * (num_ticks - price)</code></p>

<p>The formulas for determining the payout and the fees required to be paid by each side of an Order are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Total payout for closing a Long Position</strong>(<code class="prettyprint">total_payout_closing_long</code>):</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">num_shares * price / num_ticks</code></p>

<p><strong>Total payout for closing a Short Position</strong>(<code class="prettyprint">total_payout_closing_short</code>):</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">num_shares * (num_ticks - price) / num_ticks</code></p>

<p><strong>Fees paid for closing a Long Position</strong>(<code class="prettyprint">long_position_fees</code>):</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">total_payout_closing_long * fee_rate</code></p>

<p><strong>Fees paid for closing a Short Position</strong>(<code class="prettyprint">short_position_fees</code>):</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">total_payout_closing_short * fee_rate</code></p>

<aside class="notice">The Reporting section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don&rsquo;t worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>

<p><a href="images/Detailed Reporting Diagram.png"><img src="images/Detailed Reporting Diagram.png"></a></p>

<p>The Reporting Diagram above is a high level overview of <a href="#report">Reporting</a> implemented by Augur. There are four ways for a <a href="#market">Market</a> to attempt to <a href="#finalized-market">Finalize</a>: <a href="#designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</a>, <a href="#first-round-reporting">First Round Reporting</a>, <a href="#last-round-reporting">Last Round Reporting</a>, and rarely a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>. Markets in Augur have 10 potential states after Market Creation. The potential states of a Market are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pre-Reporting</li>
<li>Designated Reporting</li>
<li>Designated Dispute</li>
<li>Awaiting Migration</li>
<li>First Round Reporting</li>
<li>First Round Dispute</li>
<li>Last Round Reporting</li>
<li>Last Round Dispute</li>
<li>Fork</li>
<li>Finalized</li>
</ol>

<p>The Pre-Reporting (1) state is the time period where the market&rsquo;s <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> has not come to pass, generally this is the most active trading period. Once the End Time has come to pass, the Market will immediately enter it&rsquo;s Designated Reporting state.</p>

<p>The <a href="#designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</a> (2) state is up to three days long, also known as the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a>. During the Designated Reporting Phase the Market is expected to be <a href="#report">Reported</a> on by the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a>. As soon as the Designated Reporter submits their Report the Market will be moved into the Designated Dispute (3) state, also known as the <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a>, and <a href="#first-report-rep-bond">First Report REP Bond</a> and <a href="#first-report-gas-bond">First Report GAS Bond</a> are both refunded immediately to the Market Creator.</p>

<p>The Designated Dispute Phase lasts for three days, during which any <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder can post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> Reported by the Designated Reporter. A Market in the Designated Dispute state is considered a <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</a> because if no Dispute Bond is posted the Proposed Outcome will become the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> and the Market will be considered <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> (10).</p>

<p>If a Dispute Bond is posted during the Designated Dispute Phase, or if the Designated Reporter fails to Report during the Designated Report Phase then the Market will be moved into the Awaiting Migration (4) state. If the reason the market moves into the Awaiting Migration state is because the Designated Reporter failed to Report, then the First Report REP Bond and First Report GAS Bond are sent to the nearest <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>.</p>

<p>The Awaiting Migration (4) state can last up to 30 days and theoretically could be as short as one second long. During this time the Market is waiting for the next Reporting Window to begin so that the Market can be moved into a First Round Reporting (5) state. Reporting Windows last a total of 30 days, the first 27 days are for the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a>, the following 3 days are for the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a>. When a Reporting Window ends another Reporting Window immediately starts.</p>

<p>Once a new Reporting Window has begun, any markets in the Awaiting Migration (4) state will be moved into the First Round Reporting (5) state, and the Reporting Phase will begin. During the Reporting Phase markets in both a First Round Reporting (5) and Last Round Reporting (7) state will be reported on by <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a>.</p>

<p>In the event that a Market is moved into First Round Reporting due to a Designated Reporter failing to Report, then the first person to submit a Report will receive the First Report GAS Bond and the First Report REP Bond. The First Report REP Bond is applied to whatever stake of REP is submit with the First Report. The First Report GAS Bond is used on behalf of the First Reporter to pay for their transaction GAS cost and if there is any ETH left over it will be given to the First Reporter.</p>

<p>Once 27 days have passed the Reporting Window&rsquo;s Reporting Phase ends and the Dispute Phase begins. All Markets previously in the First Round Reporting (5) or Last Round Reporting (7) states will move into the First Round Dispute (6) and Last Round Dispute (8) states respectively. The Proposed Outcome for these Markets becomes whichever <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> had the most REP staked on it during the Reporting Phase by Reporters. During the Dispute Phase any Market in the First Round Dispute or Last Round Dispute state can be <a href="#challenge">Challenged</a> by any REP holder willing to post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a>.</p>

<p>If a Market in the First Round Dispute (6) state is challenged then it will be moved into the Last Round Reporting (7) state at the start of the next Reporting Window, which should be a maximum of three days away from the posting of the dispute bond. If a Market in the Last Round Dispute (8) state is Challenged then that Market will cause a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> and be moved into the Fork (9) state.</p>

<p>The Fork (9) state is a special and rarely entered state. A Fork lasts sixty (60) days, known as the <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a>, and creates multiple <a href="#universe">Universes</a> of Augur. Users can migrate their REP from the original  Universe, known as the <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a>, into one of the new Universes, known as a <a href="#child-universe">Child Universe</a>. Migration is one-way and final and any REP that isn&rsquo;t involved with the Forked Market is able to be migrated to the REP holder&rsquo;s chosen Child Universe. The <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>&rsquo;s staked REP is automatically moved to the Child Universe corresponding to that Outcome the REP is staked on.</p>

<p>The Universe with the most REP migrated to it by the end of the Fork Period will be chosen as the Winning Universe. Forked Markets are considered Finalized (10) in each Universe but only the Winning Universe will be able to <a href="#settlement">Settle</a> shares and reward Reporters. Forking is discussed in greater detail in the below section: <a href="#forking-details">Forking Details</a>.</p>

<p>A Market can move into the Finalized (10) state anytime they have a Reported Proposed Outcome and move through a Dispute Phase without being Challenged. Forks cannot be Challenged and the Forked Market is always considered Finalized in each Child Universe. Once a Market is Finalized, traders can <a href="#settlement">Settle</a> their <a href="#position">positions</a> with the Market.</p>

<p>Designated Reporting is designed to be fast and because of this doesn&rsquo;t leverage the decentralized oracle system built into Augur. Instead we are trusting the Market Creator&rsquo;s chosen Designated Reporter to accurately Report on the Outcome of the Market. The result of Designated Reporting is still Challengeable with a Dispute Bond so if the Designated Reporter does incorrectly Report the Outcome of the Market it can be adjudicated by First Round Reporting in the next available Reporting Window. With the dispute system in place, we don&rsquo;t actually lose any security or truth as an incorrect Proposed Outcome for a Market can be Challenged.</p>

<h2 id="designated-reporting-details">Designated Reporting Details</h2>

<p><a href="#designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</a> is a way to attempt quick <a href="#market-resolution">Market Resolution</a>. A <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> must assign a <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> during Market Creation. Designated Reporting provides the advantage of faster Market Resolution than any other type of Reporting. This is pleasing to Traders who want to <a href="#settlement">Settle</a> their <a href="#shares">Shares</a> and collect their earnings as soon as possible after a Market&rsquo;s <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> has passed. Designated Reporting begins immediately following the End Time of a Market, unlike other forms of Reporting which must wait for the next available <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> before any attempt at Market Resolution can be made.</p>

<p>Designated Reporting consists of two phases which are completely independent of the continuous cycle of Reporting Windows. The first phase is known as the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a> which, unlike a Reporting Window&rsquo;s <a href="#report-phase">Report Phase</a> which lasts 27 days, only lasts a maximum of three (3) days. The Designated Report Phase is ended immediately when the Designated Reporter submits their <a href="#report">Report</a> and the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> is set for the Market.</p>

<p>If the Designated Reporter fails to Report within the Designated Report Phase the First Report REP Bond, the First Report GAS Bond and the Market is moved into the next available Reporting Window for <a href="#first-round-reporting">First Round Reporting</a>. These Bonds will be used to help pay for the gas costs and add to the REP staked by the First Reporter to Report on this Market when First Round Reporting begins.</p>

<p>If the Designated Reporter does successful Report within the Designated Report Phase the <a href="#first-report-rep-bond">First Report REP Bond</a> and the <a href="#first-report-gas-bond">First Report GAS Bond</a> is refunded to the Market Creator immediately and the Market enters the <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a> which lasts for three (3) days. During this 3 day period any <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder can post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the Proposed Outcome Reported by the Designated Reporter. If a Dispute Bond is posted the Market is moved into the next available Reporting Window for First Round Reporting. If the Market is left unchallenged for the duration of the Designated Dispute Phase then the Market&rsquo;s Proposed Outcome becomes the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> and the Market is considered <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> allowing the Settlement of Shares.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-windows-in-detail">Reporting Windows in Detail</h2>

<p><a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Windows</a> continually occur and last for thirty (30) days. Reporting Windows have two phases, the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> and the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a>. The Reporting Phase lasts for twenty seven (27) days in which <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a> will be <a href="#report">Reporting</a> on <a href="#market">Markets</a> in the <a href="#first-round-reporting">First Round Reporting</a> and <a href="#last-round-reporting">Last Round Reporting</a> states. The Dispute Phase lasts three (3) days immediately following the Reporting Phase. During a Dispute Phase any <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder is able to post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of the Market. In order to earn <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fees</a> as a REP holder you need to Report on Markets during the Reporting Phase.</p>

<p>Markets are placed into the next available Reporting Window following the <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> of a Market. For example, if a Market&rsquo;s End Time is 12:00 AM EST on January 3rd 2053 and a Reporting Window was just started on January 1st 2053, the Market would move into the next Reporting Window that would be starting on January 31st, 2053, or 30 days since the start of the January 1st Window. <a href="#designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</a> Markets are only placed into the next available Reporting Window if they are Challenged or the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> fails to Report.</p>

<p>Any REP holder can participate in a Reporting Window. In fact, in special cases, someone without any REP is able to successfully Report on Markets in First Round Reporting. This case only occurs when the Market&rsquo;s Designated Reporter fails to Report during the Designated Report Phase. In this situation, the first person to submit a report can do so and stake 0 REP on the report. This is only the case because the First Report REP Bond is added to the First Report&rsquo;s Stake so in this case the stake can be 0 as it will get the bond added to it. This creates a race to be the First Reporter so as to attempt to get free REP from reporting correctly and earning the First Report REP Bond.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-round-details">Reporting Round Details</h2>

<p>If the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a>&rsquo;s <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a> is <a href="#challenge">Challenged</a> during the <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a> or if the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> fails to <a href="#report">Report</a> then the Market will move into <a href="#reporting-rounds">Reporting Rounds</a>. Augur currently allows for two Reporting Rounds on a Market before a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> is required to <a href="#finalized-market">Finalize the Market</a>, they are known as <a href="#first-round-reporting">First Round Reporting</a> and <a href="#last-round-reporting">Last Round Reporting</a> respectively.</p>

<p>Rounds of Reporting only occur during the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a>, which is the first 27 days, of a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. Any <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder is can stake at least 1 attoREP on an <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> for a Market being Reported on in a Reporting Round. The Outcome with the most REP staked on it at the end of the Reporting Phase will become the Proposed Outcome during the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> as the <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaits Finalization</a>. If the Market&rsquo;s Proposed Outcome isn&rsquo;t Challenged during the Dispute Phase then the Market will Finalize and the Proposed Outcome will become the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a>.</p>

<p>REP holders who staked REP on the eventual Final Outcome will receive their REP back, a portion of <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fees</a>, and a portion of the REP staked on Outcomes that weren&rsquo;t the Final Outcome. A larger stake of REP placed on the Final Outcome will result in a larger portion of the Reporting Fees and REP that is to be redistributed following the Reporting Window ending.</p>

<p>If the Market&rsquo;s Proposed Outcome is Challenged during a Dispute Phase then the Market will be elevated to the next level of Reporting Rounds in the following Reporting Window. However a Challenge to a Last Round Report will cause a Fork, which is discussed in greater detail in the <a href="#forking-details">following section</a>.</p>

<p>All Rounds of Reporting have virtually no difference between them, they operate exactly the same aside for two specific cases. One, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, is if the Last Round of Reporting is Challenged which causes a Fork. The second comes in the form of a Designated Reporter not Reporting on the Market so the Market moves to First Round Reporting. In this case the <a href="#first-report-rep-bond">First Report REP Bond</a> and the <a href="#first-report-gas-bond">First Report GAS Bond</a> are sent to the Reporting Window along with the Market.</p>

<p>The first person to Report on this Market is known as the <a href="#first-reporter">First Reporter</a>, and their Report is known as the <a href="#first-report">First Report</a>. The First Report is incentivized by Augur in two ways. The first way is the First Report GAS Bond which is used to cover the transaction cost of the First Report. If there is leftover ETH in the First Report GAS Bond after the First Report is submit then it will be sent to the First Reporter. The second way Augur incentivizes a First Report is the First Report REP Bond which is added to the Staked REP of the First Report.</p>

<p>The First Reporter doesn&rsquo;t need to be a REP holder in order to Report. This is the only case where someone without REP is able to Report. A First Reporter without any REP could stake 0 attoREP on their Report and because the First Report REP Bond is added to their stake they will have more than 1 attoREP staked, making the Report valid. If the First Reporter ends up Reporting the accurate Final Outcome they will get the First Report REP Bond back as if they had owned that REP all along. This is an interesting way to accumulate REP without needing to trade currency for it while simultaneously causing a race to Report, which helps Augur run smoothly by incentivizing at least one Report for Markets.</p>

<h2 id="forking-details">Forking Details</h2>

<p>The final state of Reporting, if needed, is the very disruptive <a href="#fork">Fork</a>. Forks are disruptive because Augur needs to assume the Decentralized Oracle System is under attack if a Fork occurs. Since Augur assumes it&rsquo;s under attack, any non-<a href="#finalized-market">Finalized Market</a> is put into a pending state, in which they will not be <a href="#report">Reported</a> on until the Fork is resolved.</p>

<p>As discussed above, if an <a href="#last-round-reporting">Last Round Reporting</a> <a href="#market">Market</a>&rsquo;s <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> is <a href="#challenged">Challenged</a> during the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> then the Market causes a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>. Forks cause the creation of <a href="#universe">Universes</a> equal to the number of <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a> for the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>. A <a href="#binary-market">Binary Market</a> that causes a Fork would create three Universes, one where the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, one where the Final Outcome is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and one where the Final Outcome is &ldquo;Invalid&rdquo;. The Universes will start with no Markets, no liquidity, and no <a href="#rep">REP</a> until someone migrates some REP to the new Universe. The only thing on a new Universe is the Finalized Forked Market.</p>

<p>All Markets created in Augur belong to a Universe. The Original Universe that contained the Market that caused the Fork to occur will become locked once the Fork happens, this Universe is considered the <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a>. Markets are always tradable, no matter what state they are in or what Universe. While trading can still take place in the Parent Universe, new Markets cannot be created in a <a href="#locked-universe">Locked Universe</a>, however they can be created in any of the new Universes spawned by the Fork, known as <a href="#child-universe">Child Universes</a>.</p>

<p>Forking causes the REP remaining in the Locked Universe to no longer have the ability to earn fees from Reporting as there will never be new Markets to Report on. REP holders are given the option to Migrate their REP to one of the Child Universes created by the Fork. Migration should be considered very carefully as it only happens in one direction and is irreversible, however if you ever want to use your REP to earn Reporting Fees again you will need to choose a Child Universe to Migrate too. There is no time limit on when a REP holder is allowed to migrate, they can choose to do it immediately after a Fork or wait for the Fork to resolve. REP staked on the Forked Market is automatically migrated to the Child Universe that belongs to the Outcome the REP is staked on, you cannot choose the Child Universe like you can with any of your other REP.</p>

<p>It should be noted that each Child Universe of a Fork will have their own version of REP. In other words, a new REP contract is created for each Child Universe that has REP from the Parent Universe&rsquo;s REP contract migrated to it. Only REP belonging to the Universe is valid REP to use within that Universe. Migrating REP from the Parent Universe to a Child Universe can be thought of as a permanent conversion of Parent Universe REP into Child Universe REP.</p>

<p>After a Fork occurs, a <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a> begins and lasts for sixty (60) days, during which Reporting is put on hold. Once the Fork Period ends, a Winning Universe will be decided based on which Universe had the most REP migrated to it during the Fork Period. The Winning Universe is the Universe where pending Markets will be migrated to in order to allow them to be resolved by Reporting. Formally pending Markets will immediately reenter the <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a>. The Winning Universe is the only Universe in which <a href="#settlement">Settlement</a> will take place for the Forked Market. Although a Winning Universe is going to emerge from a Fork, the &ldquo;Losing&rdquo; Universes created by the Fork aren&rsquo;t any less valid than the Winning Universe, they are just less likely to see Markets created on them if the far majority of users are using the Winning Universe.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the timeline and actions that users perform from the time a Market is created to the time a Fork ends and the Market is Finalized.</p>

          <h1 id="api-overview">API Overview</h1>

<aside class="notice">The API Overview section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don&rsquo;t worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>

<p>augur.js is a collection of JavaScript APIs that can be used to query for information about Augur&rsquo;s <a href="#market">Markets</a> and interact with Augur&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core">smart contracts</a>. The documentation for augur.js is divided into four sections: the <a href="#simplified-api">Simplified API</a>, the <a href="#call-api">Call API</a>, the <a href="#transaction-api">Transaction API</a>, and the <a href="#events-api">Events API</a>. The Simplified API provides general information about Markets within Augur, and many of its functions require a connection to an <a href="#augur-node">Augur Node</a> (covered in the next section). The Call and Transaction APIs provide direct mappings to Augur&rsquo;s smart contract methods via the <code class="prettyprint">augur.api</code> object. The Call API uses <code class="prettyprint">eth_call</code> to make &ldquo;get&rdquo; requests for information stored on the blockchain. The Transaction API uses <code class="prettyprint">eth_sendTransaction</code> to make &ldquo;set&rdquo; requests to the blockchain in order to modify the blockchain&rsquo;s information in some way, like creating a new <a href="#order">Order</a> on the <a href="#order-book">Order Book</a>. The Events API enables listening for certain logged events and searching for them. The Call, Transaction, and Events APIs do not require a connection to an Augur Node. Each of these four components of augur.js is covered in greater detail in their respective sections below.</p>

<p>In this section, we will go over how to import augur.js into your project and connect it to an Ethereum Node. This section will also cover market creation, and initial market loading.</p>

<p>Augur&rsquo;s JavaScript API is a set of JavaScript bindings for the methods encoded in Augur&rsquo;s <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/">Solidity</a> <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core">smart contracts</a>. The API method name, as well as its parameters as keys in the <code class="prettyprint">params</code> object, are generally identical to those of the underlying smart contract method.</p>

<p>Augur&rsquo;s smart contracts run on Ethereum&rsquo;s decentralized network. The various serialization, networking, and formatting tasks required to communicate with the Augur contracts from a web application are carried out by Augur&rsquo;s <a href="#architecture">middleware</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur.js">augur.js</a> is the Augur JavaScript SDK, and is the user-facing component of the middleware. It is the recommended way to interact with Augur&rsquo;s smart contracts from a custom application. </p>

<p>The easiest way to install augur.js is using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/augur.js">npm</a>:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm install augur.js</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, this can be done using <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/augur.js">yarn</a>, as follows:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn add augur.js</code></p>

<p>To use the Augur API, <code class="prettyprint">augur.js</code> must connect to an Ethereum node, which can be either local or remote (hosted). To specify the connection endpoint, pass your RPC connection info to <code class="prettyprint">augur.connect</code>. Augur will go through the list of potential connections provided by the <code class="prettyprint">options</code> argument and attempt to connect to each in turn until one of the connections is successful or all attempts fail. The Ethereum node may have multiple http, websocket, or ipc addresses specified as arrays. The Augur Node, however, can only have one websocket address specified.</p>

<p>In the example, the first connection that will be tried is <code class="prettyprint">http://127.0.0.1:8545</code>, which is our local Ethereum node being run using the Geth client. If a connection to the local Geth node cannot be established, the next provided address will be tried. In this case, we have provided a single hosted node (<code class="prettyprint">https://eth9000.augur.net</code>) as another attempt to make after the local Geth node. If a connection is successfully established, then a <code class="prettyprint">vitals</code> object will be returned, otherwise an error message will be returned.</p>

<p>Anyone wishing to query for information about Augur&rsquo;s markets will need to use the augur.js <a href="#simplified-api">Simplified API</a>, which requires a connection to an <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-node">Augur Node</a>. Augur Node is a standalone application that scans the Ethereum blockchain for all Augur event logs and stores them to a SQLite or PostgresSQL database.</p>

<p>Instead of looking up information about Augur-related events directly on the Ethereum blockchain, the Simplified API sends query requests to an Augur Node&rsquo;s database. This is because looking up information directly on the blockchain can be a slow and difficult process, especially when sorting is required. For example, to run a query for all <a href="#markets">Markets</a> created by a specific user, sorted by volume and limited to 100 results, would require scanning the blockchain for all Market creation events by that user, saving the results locally, querying each Market to obtain its volume, saving those results locally, and then sorting the Markets created by the user and discarding everything after the first 100 results. This would require a large number of RPC requests and would take a long time to complete.</p>

<p>To alleviate this problem, the Simplified API executes queries by submitting an RPC request to an Augur Node that is either running locally or remotely (hosted). The Augur Node then runs the request against its database and returns the result. This allows queries to be run on Augur much more quickly than would otherwise be possible.</p>

<p>To set up a local Augur Node, follow the instructions described in the <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-node#augur-node">Augur Node GitHub repository</a>. Once a local Augur Node is running (or if the websocket address of a hosted node is known), a connection to it can be established by specifying the websocket address as shown by the JavaScript sample code on the right.</p>

<span class="c1">// augur.js does not store any account data. augur.js simply returns the important information. You can use the privateKey Buffer returned to sign your transactions.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>augur.js includes a trustless account management system. The purpose of the accounts system is to allow people to use Augur without needing to run an Ethereum node themselves, as running a full Ethereum node can be resource-intensive.</p>

<p>To use the account system, the user specifies a password. Everything else is done automatically for the user. The only requirement for the password is that it be at least 6 characters long.</p>

<p>A private key (+ derived public key and address) is automatically generated for the user.  A secret key derived from the password using PBKDF2, along with a random 128-bit initialization vector, is used to encrypt the private key (using AES-256). Nothing is stored by augur.js. The account object will be returned to the callback provided or simply returned if no callback is provided.</p>

<p>The Augur UI will handle your account information for you, but if you are using augur.js on it&rsquo;s own you will need to manage the account yourself. augur.js doesn&rsquo;t sign any transactions for you if you aren&rsquo;t using the Augur UI.</p>

<p>If you want to use the augur.js API directly, you will need to sign any transaction that will modify information on the blockchain (non-call transactions). All transactions take a <code class="prettyprint">_signer</code> parameter which should be set to the sending account&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">privateKey</code> Buffer or a function that will sign a transaction (hardware wallet).</p>

<aside class="notice">Since the user&rsquo;s account key is an ordinary Ethereum private key, the user&rsquo;s key (and therefore their funds and Reputation) can be used with any Ethereum node. Therefore, although the accounts system is managed using an ordinary web server, since the user&rsquo;s funds are neither tied to nor controlled by our server, the accounts are still decentralized in the ways that (in our opinion) matter.</aside>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p>Before we move on, let&rsquo;s quickly talk about Numbers. There are three acceptable ways to pass numerical inputs to the Augur API:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>primitive JS numbers (e.g., <code class="prettyprint">1010101</code>): ok for integers, but use strings for floating point numbers (see below)</p></li>
<li><p>stringified numbers (e.g., <code class="prettyprint">&quot;1010101&quot;</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>hexadecimal strings (e.g., <code class="prettyprint">&quot;0xf69b5&quot;</code>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Floating-point (decimal) values should be passed to augur.js as strings (e.g., instead of <code class="prettyprint">0.07</code>, use <code class="prettyprint">&quot;0.07&quot;</code>), for reasons described in <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">enormous detail</a> elsewhere.</p>

<aside class="notice"><b>All numerical parameters passed to augur.js must be either base 10 (decimal) or base 16 (hexadecimal).</b> Do <b>not</b> use the base 10<sup>18</sup> fixed-point representation that Augur uses internally for decimals!  augur.js handles all fixed-point conversions for you.  Do <b>not</b> send the Loch Ness monster 3.50 &times; 10<sup>18</sup> ETH.  (Probably don&rsquo;t even give him 3.50, but that&rsquo;s a debate for another time.)</aside>

<h2 id="initial-market-loading">Initial market loading</h2>

<p>To get a list of all <a href="#market">Markets</a>, first call <code class="prettyprint">augur.markets.getMarkets({ universe[, sortBy, isSortDescending, limit, offset] }[, callback])</code>. More detailed market info (including prices) for each market can then be loaded using <code class="prettyprint">augur.markets.getMarketsInfo({ marketIDs }[, callback])</code>. <code class="prettyprint">getMarketsInfo</code> does not return the <a href="#order-book">Open Orders</a> for the Market; to get the Open Orders, call <code class="prettyprint">augur.trading.getOrders({ [universe, marketID, outcome, orderType, creator, orderState, earliestCreationTime, latestCreationTime, sortBy, isSortDescending, limit, offset] }[, callback])</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.setDebugOptions</code> allows several debugging options to be enabled:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code class="prettyprint">broadcast</code> - When set to true, this enables printing of verbose, low-level information related to sending/receiving transactions, such as the transaction JSON that gets sent out over the wire, incoming eth_subscription messages, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="prettyprint">connect</code> - When set to true, this enables printing of the result of the initial connection of ethrpc to the underlying Ethereum node, as well as which endpoints are connected, on which protocols</p></li>
<li><p><code class="prettyprint">tx</code> - When set to true, this enables printing of information related to transaction construction/submission/confirmation. This information includes the intermediate &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; object with human-readable parameters, the (best-guess) return value fetched from the follow-up eth_call when a transaction gets resubmitted, and the transaction hash once the transaction is submitted.</p></li>
</ul>

          <h1 id="simplified-api">Simplified API</h1>

<aside class="notice">The Simplified API section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don&rsquo;t worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>

<aside class="warning">The Simplified API provides an easy way to make transactions and query for information within Augur. This API is simplified in the sense that single requests to this API can be used to fetch a large amount of data, without the need for complicated RPC batch queries. However, many of the functions in this API require a connection to an <a href="#augur-node">Augur Node</a>, which has been indicated in their descriptions. Please read the <a href="#augur-node">Augur Node</a> section before using these functions.</aside>

<p>All optional parameters are listed in brackets. Most of the Simplified API functions contain optional parameters for specifying which results to return and how to sort them.  For example, <code class="prettyprint">sortBy</code> should be a string corresponding to the name of a particular field to sort by, and <code class="prettyprint">isSortDescending</code> should be a boolean value for whether to sort the results in descending order. <code class="prettyprint">limit</code> should be an integer greater than 0 that represents the maximum number of results to return. <code class="prettyprint">offset</code> should be an integer greater than 0. It is used when only a portion of the total query results is desired, and it represents the record number at which to start returning results.</p>

<aside class="notice">The Call API section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don&rsquo;t worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>

<p>Augur&rsquo;s Call API is made up of &ldquo;getter&rdquo; methods that retrieve information from the blockchain (using Ethereum&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">eth_call</code> RPC) but does not write information to the blockchain. The Call API is for more granular &ldquo;gets&rdquo; than the <a href="#simplified-api">Simplified API</a> allows for. The Call API is directly mapped to the Augur Contracts and their publicly exposed methods. All Call API functions will accept two arguments, a <code class="prettyprint">params</code> object with key/value pairs that match inputs for the contract method and a callback function. The Augur API functions are attached to the <code class="prettyprint">augur.api</code> object and follow a pattern of <code class="prettyprint">augur.api.&lt;Contract Name&gt;.&lt;Contract Method&gt;(&lt;Params Object&gt;, &lt;Callback Function&gt;)</code>. Although technically optional, the Augur team <strong>strongly recommends</strong> using a callback. Without the callback the calls will be synchronous which can lock up your browser until they complete.</p>

<aside class="warning">Synchronous HTTP RPC is generally not recommended, especially if augur.js is running in the browser. Synchronous RPC requests block the main JavaScript thread, which essentially freezes the browser!</aside>

The Dispute Bond is only purchasable with REP. Only one Dispute Bond needs to be purchased for a Market per round of <a href="#reporting">Reporting</a> in order for the Market to move to the next state of <a href="#report">Reporting</a> in the next upcoming <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. If a Challenge is successful, which means the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> of the <a href="#market">Market</a> is something other than the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> that was disputed, then the Bond Holder is entitled to up to 2x the Dispute Bond cost in REP.

<p>Every <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> consists of two phases, the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> and the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a>. This method is used to return the timestamp for the end of the Reporting Window&rsquo;s Dispute Phase.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-reportingwindow-getdisputestarttime-tx-callback">augur.api.ReportingWindow.getDisputeStartTime({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>As stated above, <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Windows</a> have two phases, the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> and <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> and this method returns the timestamp of the start of the Dispute Phase.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-reportingwindow-getendtime-tx-callback">augur.api.ReportingWindow.getEndTime({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns a timestamp for when this <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> will end. A Reporting Window is considered active for a total of 30 days, then ends, and is no longer considered to be active.</p>

NOTE: If the Reporting Window has not begun yet, this number will include Markets that may end up being <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> in the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Round</a>. Since it is unknown whether <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporters</a> ultimately will submit a report, Augur assumes by default that all new Markets will go to the First Report Round. Once the Reporting Window has begun, this function will return the number of Markets that are actually in the First Report Round.</p>

<p>The Reputation Token, known as <a href="#rep">REP</a>, is the key that allows Augur&rsquo;s Decentralized Oracle System to function, and by extension the entirety of Augur. REP has three major functions, it&rsquo;s used to <a href="#report">Report</a> on the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a>, <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a Market, and as a bond when creating a Market. <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a> stake REP on the Outcome of a Market as a show of confidence in their Report. If the Reporter correctly staked on the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> of the Market they can claim their REP back, earn <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fees</a> proportional to their staked REP, and a portion of the REP incorrectly staked on other Outcomes.</p>

<p>REP is also used to Challenge the Proposed Outcome of Reports during the <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a> or the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a>. If the Challenge successfully changes the Proposed Outcome of a Market and that outcome becomes the Final Outcome, the <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> holder can redeem the bond for up to double the REP it cost to place. When creating a Market, the Market Creator is required to specify a Designated Reporter and pay a <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</a> to ensure the Designated Reporter shows up. If the Reporter doesn&rsquo;t show up, the Market Creator&rsquo;s Designated Report No-Show REP Bond will go to the First Reporter to Report on the Market. Their GAS cost for the Report transaction will be covered by the Market Creator&rsquo;s <a href="#designated-report-no-show-gas-bond">Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond</a> and the Designated Report No-Show REP Bond is added to whatever the First Reporter staked, there by improving her stake and potential rewards if correctly staked.</p>

<p>The Reputation Token is an ERC-20 token that implements all of the required functions listed in the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md">ERC-20 Token Standard</a>. It does not, however, implement the optional functions.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-reputationtoken-getuniverse-tx-callback">augur.api.ReputationToken.getUniverse({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> address for the <a href="#rep">REP</a> address provided. All of Augur&rsquo;s information belongs to a Universe and each Universe has it&rsquo;s own REP contract. New Universes are created in the event of a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-reputationtoken-gettopmigrationdestination-tx-callback">augur.api.ReputationToken.getTopMigrationDestination({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>As mentioned in the previous method description, all of Augur&rsquo;s <a href="#universe">Universes</a> have their own <a href="#rep">REP</a> contract, specific to that Universe. In the event of a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> occurring, REP holders are expected to migrate their REP to one of the newly created <a href="#child-universe">Child Universes</a>. The Child Universe with the most REP migrated to it at the end of the 60 day <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a> will be the only Universe that allows for <a href="#settlement">Settlement</a> on the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a> and will be the Universe that all pending <a href="#market">Markets</a> will migrate to for <a href="#report">Reporting</a>. What this method does is returns the Universe address of the currently &ldquo;winning&rdquo; migration destination. In other words, this returns the Universe with the most REP migrated to it so far.</p>

<p>The Stake Token is used to represent Staked <a href="#rep">REP</a> by a <a href="#reporter">Reporter</a> for a specific <a href="#report">Report</a> and <a href="#market">Market</a>. When a Reporter submits a Report during a <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a> for this Market they need to stake REP based on how confident they are in the Report. The REP staked is converted into Stake Tokens. A new type of Stake Token is created for each <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> submit by Reporters. Stake Tokens are then redeemed after <a href="#finalized-market">Finalizing the Market</a>. If your Stake Tokens are the tokens that represent the Winning Payout Set then your Stake Tokens can be redeemed for the amount of REP that was staked as well as a portion of <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fee</a> and REP staked on any other <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> but the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a>. If your tokens are Staked on any other Outcome they are worthless and the Staked REP is redistributed to people with winning Stake Tokens.</p>

<p>The Stake Token is an ERC-20 token that implements all of the required functions listed in the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md">ERC-20 Token Standard</a>. It does not, however, implement the optional functions.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-getmarket-tx-callback">augur.api.StakeToken.getMarket({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>This method will return the <a href="#market">Market</a> address that the Stake Token belongs too. Every Stake Token belongs to a specific Market in which the Token acts as a 1 to 1 representation of Staked <a href="#rep">REP</a> for a particular <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> representing a <a href="#report">Report</a> for the Market.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-getpayoutdistributionhash-tx-callback">augur.api.StakeToken.getPayoutDistributionHash({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the <a href="#payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</a> for a specific <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code>. A Payout Distribution Hash is a sha3 hash of the <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> the Stake Token represents. The Payout Distribution Hash is used in other contract methods to identify a particular Payout Set.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-getpayoutnumerator-tx-index-callback">augur.api.StakeToken.getPayoutNumerator({ tx, index }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the value at the <code class="prettyprint">index</code> of the <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> represented by this <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code>. The <code class="prettyprint">index</code> is a value between <code class="prettyprint">0</code> and number of <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a> for the <a href="#market">Market</a> and corresponds to a particular Outcome of the Market. In a <a href="#binary-market">Binary Market</a> for example, there are only two Outcomes, so the allowable <code class="prettyprint">index</code> values are 0 and 1.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-getreportingwindow-tx-callback">augur.api.StakeToken.getReportingWindow({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> address for the specified <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code>. All Stake Tokens belong to a specific <a href="#market">Market</a> and all Market&rsquo;s belong to a specific Reporting Window. This method will return the Reporting Window that contains the Market that these Stake Tokens were purchased for.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-getreputationtoken-tx-callback">augur.api.StakeToken.getReputationToken({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, a Stake Token belongs to a <a href="#market">Market</a> which in turn belongs to a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. Reporting Windows only interact with a single <a href="#rep">REP</a> contract, and this method will return the contract address of valid REP for this Reporting Window and by extension these Stake Tokens. Stake Tokens can only be purchased with REP that belongs to the Reporting Window the tokens are ultimately contained within.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-getuniverse-tx-callback">augur.api.StakeToken.getUniverse({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> address for the specified <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code>&rsquo;s <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. Everything in Augur belongs to a Universe, and Stake Tokens are no different. New Universes are created in the event of a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>, so this method provides an API user the ability to find out which Universe the Stake Token is currently in.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-isvalid-tx-callback">augur.api.StakeToken.isValid({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>This method is used as a way to check if the <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code> represents a <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> that indicates the <a href="#market">Market</a> is Invalid. This isn&rsquo;t to say that the Stake Token, the <a href="#report">Report</a>, or the Payout Set is invalid, but rather the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of the Market is unclear based on how the Market is worded or the result of Market doesn&rsquo;t correspond to any of the Outcomes set for the Market.</p>

<p>The Universe Contract is the contract that defines an Augur <a href="#universe">Universe</a> and the methods used to interact with them. All of Augur&rsquo;s <a href="#market">Markets</a>, <a href="#order-book">Order Books</a>, <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Windows</a>, and <a href="#rep">REP</a> belong to a specific Universe. In the rare event that an <a href="#last-report-round">Last Report Round</a> Market&rsquo;s <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> is <a href="#challenge">Challenged</a> during the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> of a Reporting Window then a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> will occur and new Universes will be created. The Universe that originally contained the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a> will become a <a href="#locked-universe">Locked Universe</a>, thereby not allowing any Market creation to take place in the Locked Universe. The newly created Universes are known as <a href="#child-universe">Child Universes</a>, where as the original and now Locked Universe is considered those Child Universes&rsquo; <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a>.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getchilduniverse-tx-_parentpayoutdistributionhash-callback">augur.api.Universe.getChildUniverse({ tx, _parentPayoutDistributionHash }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the Child <a href="#universe">Universe</a> address for this <code class="prettyprint">universe</code> address whose <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>&rsquo;s <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> is the <code class="prettyprint">_parentPayoutDistributionHash</code> <a href="#payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</a> provided.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getcurrentreportingwindow-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getCurrentReportingWindow({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the address of the current running <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> of the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code>. Every Universe has Reporting Windows that are continually run for a duration of 30 days before immediately starting the next Window.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getforkendtime-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getForkEndTime({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the timestamp for when the <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a> ends that was started on the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code>. If there is no <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a> in the Universe, this function will return 0.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getforkingmarket-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getForkingMarket({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the contract address of the <a href="#market">Market</a> that the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code> is <a href="#fork">Forking</a> over. This returns the null address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) if the Universe has never Forked and there is no <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getforkreputationgoal-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getForkReputationGoal({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the estimated amount of <a href="#rep">REP</a> that must be migrated to one <a href="#child-universe">Child Universe</a> in order to allow a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> in the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code> to be finalized before the end of the <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a>.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getnextreportingwindow-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getNextReportingWindow({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the address of the <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> coming up after the current Reporting Window ends in the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code>.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getopeninterestinattoeth-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getOpenInterestInAttoEth({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the total value of all <a href="#complete-sets">Complete Sets</a> that exist across all <a href="#market">Markets</a> the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code>, priced in attoETH.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getparentuniverse-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getParentUniverse({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a> address of the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code>. When a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> occurs, <a href="#child-universe">Child Universes</a> are created and the original <a href="#universe">Universe</a> that contained the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a> would become a Parent Universe to the newly created Universes. If this is called on the very first Augur Universe then it will return 0, as the first Universe had no Parent Universe.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-universe-getparentpayoutdistributionhash-tx-callback">augur.api.Universe.getParentPayoutDistributionHash({ tx }[, callback])</h4>

<p>Returns the <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universes</a>&rsquo;s <a href="#payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</a> for <a href="#child-universe">Child Universe</a> specified in <code class="prettyprint">tx</code>.

<p>Augur&rsquo;s Transaction API (&ldquo;Tx API&rdquo; for short) is made up of &ldquo;setter&rdquo; methods that can both read from and write to the blockchain using Ethereum&rsquo;s <code class="prettyprint">eth_sendTransaction</code> RPC. Under the hood, the API uses augur.js&rsquo;s convenience wrapper for <code class="prettyprint">eth_sendTransaction</code> which can be accessed using <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code>. Although it is possible to call <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> directly, which is discussed in greater detail below, it is generally better and easier to use the built in API functions. The API functions are attached to the <code class="prettyprint">augur.api</code> object and follow a pattern of <code class="prettyprint">augur.api.&lt;Contract&gt;.&lt;Method&gt;(&lt;Argument Object&gt;)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="arguments">Arguments</h3>

<p>All Transaction API methods accept a single object argument. This single object must contain the <code class="prettyprint">onSent</code>, <code class="prettyprint">onSuccess</code>, and <code class="prettyprint">onFailed</code> callback fields. This single object should contain all required params for the transactions as key/value pairs. This is different to the <a href="#call-api">Call API</a> methods which accept a params object and a second optional argument for the callback. It is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you use a callback, even if it&rsquo;s optional in the Call API, as that will ensure your requests are made asynchronously.</p>

<h3 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h3>

<p>All Transaction API methods accept three callback functions within the argument object. The following keys are used for each callback:</p>

<h4 id="onsent-sentresponse">onSent(sentResponse)</h4>

<p>Fires when the initial <code class="prettyprint">eth_sendTransaction</code> response is received.  If the transaction was broadcast to the network without problems, <code class="prettyprint">sentResponse</code> will have two fields: <code class="prettyprint">txHash</code> (the transaction hash as a hex string) and <code class="prettyprint">callReturn</code> (the value returned by the invoked contract method). The optional <code class="prettyprint">returns</code> field in the <code class="prettyprint">payload</code> object sent to <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> can be used to specify the format of the <code class="prettyprint">callReturn</code> value.</p>

<h4 id="onsuccess-successresponse">onSuccess(successResponse)</h4>

<p>Fires when the transaction is successfully incorporated into a block and added to the blockchain, as indicated by a nonzero <code class="prettyprint">blockHash</code> value. <code class="prettyprint">successResponse</code> is structured the same way as <code class="prettyprint">eth_getTransactionByHash</code> responses (see code example for details), with the addition of a <code class="prettyprint">callReturn</code> field which contains the contract method&rsquo;s return value.</p>

<h4 id="onfailed-failedresponse">onFailed(failedResponse)</h4>

<p>Fires if the transaction is unsuccessful. <code class="prettyprint">failedResponse</code> has <code class="prettyprint">error</code> (error code) and <code class="prettyprint">message</code> (error description) fields, describing the way in which the transaction failed.</p>

<h3 id="signer">Signer</h3>

<p>In addition to the arguments and callbacks, all Transaction API functions require a <code class="prettyprint">_signer</code> param. The <code class="prettyprint">_signer</code> param should be set to the private key buffer or a signing function, provided by a hardware wallet, of the account who wishes to initiate the transaction. The Transaction API functions all attempt to modify information on the blockchain which requires a signed transaction. Anytime you plan to modify or &ldquo;set&rdquo; information on the blockchain you will need to include a <code class="prettyprint">_signer</code> param. This concept is discussed in a bit more detail in the next section.</p>

<aside class="warning">While it is possible to use <code>augur.rpc.transact</code> directly, it is generally easier and less error-prone to use one of the named API functions documented in the following sections. Readers who want to use the Transaction API and aren&rsquo;t terribly curious about the augur.js/ethrpc plumbing under the hood should jump to the next section!</aside>

<h4 id="augur-rpc-transact-payload-privatekeyorsigner-accounttype-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.rpc.transact(payload, privateKeyOrSigner, accountType, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed)</h4>

<p>You can broadcast transactions to the Ethereum Network by calling <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> directly. If called directly, the <code class="prettyprint">payload</code> object needs to be constructed by hand and must be structured correctly.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">payload</code> object, also known as the &ldquo;transaction object&rdquo;, is structured as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Required:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>to: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;contract address&gt; (hexstring)</code></li>
<li>name: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;function name&gt; (string)</code></li>
<li>signature: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;function signature, e.g. [&quot;int256&quot;, &quot;bytes&quot;, &quot;int256[]&quot;]&gt; (array)</code></li>
<li>params: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;parameters passed to the function&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Optional:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>send: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;true to sendTransaction, false to call (default)&gt;</code></li>
<li>from: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;sender&#39;s address&gt; (hexstring; defaults to the coinbase account)</code></li>
<li>returns: <code class="prettyprint">&lt;&quot;int256&quot; (default), &quot;int&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;int256[]&quot;, &quot;number[]&quot;, or &quot;string&quot;&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">params</code> and <code class="prettyprint">signature</code> fields are required if your function accepts parameters; otherwise, these fields can be excluded. The <code class="prettyprint">returns</code> field is used only to format the output, and does not affect the actual RPC request.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">privateKeyOrSigner</code> is required if we are attempting to execute a transaction that will modify the blockchain (<code class="prettyprint">eth_sendTransaction</code>). If we are simply getting information (<code class="prettyprint">eth_call</code>) we don&rsquo;t need to pass anything for <code class="prettyprint">privateKeyOrSigner</code>. <code class="prettyprint">privateKeyOrSigner</code> should be the Private Key Buffer for the logged in account or a function to sign transactions provided by a hardware wallet.</p>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">accountType</code> is a string that can be &ldquo;privateKey&rdquo;, &ldquo;uPort&rdquo;, or &ldquo;ledger&rdquo;, depending on the type of account that is sending the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Under the hood <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> carries out the following sequence:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> will first attempt to use <code class="prettyprint">eth_call</code> on the transaction submitted in order to determine if there is enough GAS to perform the transaction and that the transaction is properly formed. If you have a malformed transaction, didn&rsquo;t provide enough GAS, or the transaction will fail then an error is passed to the <code class="prettyprint">onFailed</code> handler and the <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> sequence terminates.</p></li>
<li><p>After confirming that the Transaction is valid, <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> will send a <code class="prettyprint">eth_sendTransaction</code> RPC request (or <code class="prettyprint">eth_sendRawTransaction</code> for transactions which are already signed), which broadcasts the transaction to the Ethereum Network. If no transaction hash is received or there is an error, then the error will be passed to the <code class="prettyprint">onFailed</code> handler and the <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> sequence will terminate. Otherwise, the <code class="prettyprint">onSent</code> handler will be called and return an object containing the <code class="prettyprint">txHash</code> and <code class="prettyprint">callReturn</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>After calling the <code class="prettyprint">onSent</code> handler, Augur will add the transaction to the <code class="prettyprint">transactions</code> object (which is indexed by transaction hash, e.g. <code class="prettyprint">transactions[txHash]</code>) and assign the transaction a <code class="prettyprint">status</code> of <code class="prettyprint">&quot;pending&quot;</code>. Use <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.getTransactions()</code> to access the <code class="prettyprint">transactions</code> object.</p></li>
<li><p>Augur then uses <code class="prettyprint">eth_getTransactionByHash</code> to determine if the transaction has been mined or not, indicated by a <code class="prettyprint">null</code> response. A <code class="prettyprint">null</code> response indicates that the transaction has been (silently) removed from geth&rsquo;s transaction pool. This can happen if the transaction is a duplicate of another transaction that has not yet cleared the transaction pool (and therefore geth does not fire a duplicate transaction error), or if the transaction&rsquo;s nonce (but not its other fields) is a duplicate. If a <code class="prettyprint">null</code> response is received from <code class="prettyprint">eth_getTransactionByHash</code> then Augur will attempt to re-submit the transaction to <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> as long the amount of attempts hasn&rsquo;t exceeded <code class="prettyprint">augur.constants.TX_RETRY_MAX</code>. If the attempts to submit the transaction exceed <code class="prettyprint">augur.constants.TX_RETRY_MAX</code> then a <code class="prettyprint">TRANSACTION_RETRY_MAX_EXCEEDED</code> error will be sent to the <code class="prettyprint">onFailed</code> handler and the <code class="prettyprint">augur.rpc.transact</code> sequence will terminate.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the transaction has been successfully mined (<code class="prettyprint">eth_getTransactionByHash</code> successfully returns the transaction object) the transaction is updated to include the <code class="prettyprint">blockNumber</code> and <code class="prettyprint">blockHash</code> and its <code class="prettyprint">status</code> is changed to <code class="prettyprint">&quot;sealed&quot;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>When the amount of confirmations of our transaction exceeds <code class="prettyprint">augur.constants.REQUIRED_CONFIRMATIONS</code> then the transaction is updated to a status of <code class="prettyprint">&quot;confirmed&quot;</code>. A <code class="prettyprint">callReturn</code> field is added to the transaction object, which is then passed to the <code class="prettyprint">onSuccess</code> handler, completing the sequence.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This transaction will create a new order on the order book for the specified <code class="prettyprint">_market</code> trading on the <code class="prettyprint">_outcome</code> provided. The required fields besides market and outcome are the <code class="prettyprint">_type</code> of order (1 for a bid, 2 for an ask), amount of shares denoted in <code class="prettyprint">_attoshares</code>, and the <code class="prettyprint">_displayPrice</code> for the order. Optional params include <code class="prettyprint">_betterOrderId</code>, <code class="prettyprint">_worseOrderId</code>, <code class="prettyprint">_tradeGroupId</code>, and the callbacks. The <code class="prettyprint">_betterOrderId</code> and <code class="prettyprint">_worseOrderId</code> are orderIDs of orders already on the order book which should be better and worse than the order we are intending to create with this transaction. The <code class="prettyprint">_tradeGroupId</code> is a field used by the Augur UI to group transactions and can be left blank.</p>

<p>This transaction will fail if <code class="prettyprint">_type</code> is not a valid value of 1 or 2, If the <code class="prettyprint">_attoshares</code> value is less than 0, if the <code class="prettyprint">_market</code> isn&rsquo;t defined, if the <code class="prettyprint">_outcome</code> is less than 0 or greater than the total number of outcomes for the <code class="prettyprint">_market</code>, or if the <code class="prettyprint">_displayPrice</code> is below the <code class="prettyprint">_market</code>&rsquo;s minimum <code class="prettyprint">_displayPrice</code> or if the <code class="prettyprint">_displayPrice</code> is above the market&rsquo;s maximum <code class="prettyprint">_displayPrice</code>.</p>

If a Challenge is successful, which means the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> of the <a href="#market">Market</a> is something other than the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> that was disputed, then the Bond Holder is entitled to up to 2x the Dispute Bond cost in REP.

<p>If a critical bug or vulnerability is found in Augur, the development team can put it the system into a haulted state until the issue is resolved. In such instances, most regularly-used functions in Augur&rsquo;s backend will become unuseable until the system is returned to its normal state. When this happens, users can call the <code class="prettyprint">withdrawInEmergency</code> function to withdraw their Dispute Bond and convert it into a Reputation Token.</p>

<p>This transaction will fail if Augur is not currently in a haulted state.</p>

<p>It returns true if the Dispute Bond was successfully withdrawn and converted to a Reputation Token. (NOTE: The return value cannot be obtained reliably when calling externally.)</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-derivepayoutdistributionhash-market-_payoutnumerators-_invalid-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.derivePayoutDistributionHash({ market, _payoutNumerators, _invalid, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>Returns the <a href="#payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</a> for the <code class="prettyprint">_payoutNumerators</code> and <code class="prettyprint">_invalid</code> passed in. If the <a href="#payout-set">Payout Sets</a>, referred to as Payout Numerator in the function, is valid, then a Payout Distribution Hash is created by hashing the Payout Sets and <code class="prettyprint">_invalid</code> using keccak256.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-disavowtokens-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.disavowTokens({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction is used to disavow Stake Tokens for this <a href="#market">Market</a>. When a Stake Token is disavowed it is able to be redeemed from the Market for the full <a href="#rep">REP</a> price of purchase. This is used in the event of a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>, which causes all Markets that aren&rsquo;t <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> to enter an Awaiting Fork Migration state for the duration of the <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a>. During this time, the Market is unable to proceed through the <a href="#market-resolution">Market Resolution</a> process until the Fork Period is completed and a winning <a href="#child-universe">Child Universe</a> is known. To withdraw REP from the Staked Tokens on Markets Awaiting Fork Migration the Stake Tokens must be disavowed by calling <code class="prettyprint">disavowTokens</code> on the Market. The Stake Tokens are then disavowed for the entire Market and can be sold back to the Market for full REP price. This then allows the REP holder to migrate their REP to their chosen Child Universe.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-disputedesignatedreport-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.disputeDesignatedReport({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction is used to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a> that was <a href="#report">Reported</a> on by a <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> and is currently in the <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a>. The <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> of this transaction must have <a href="#rep">REP</a> to pay for the <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a>. This transaction will cause the Market to go to the first available <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> and enter the <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a>. If the caller of this function would like to increase the number of <a href="#stake-token">Stake Tokens</a> he or she has on an outcome other than the one reported by the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a>, that can be done by passing in an amount greater than 0 for <code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code> equal to the amount of Stake Tokens he or she would like to purchase. Additionally, <code class="prettyprint">_payoutNumerators</code> should be an array of the specific <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> desired, and <code class="prettyprint">_invalid</code> should be set to true or false, depending on whether the caller thinks the market should be resolved as invalid. Alternatively, if the caller does not wish to increase his or her amount of Stake Tokens on a particular outcome, these parameters will be ignored as long as <code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code> is less than 1.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-disputefirstreporters-market-_payoutnumerators-_attotokens-_invalid-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.disputeFirstReporters({ market, _payoutNumerators, _attotokens, _invalid, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction will <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a> <a href="#market">Market</a> if the Market is currently in the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> and is <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaiting Finalization</a>. The <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> needs to have enough <a href="#rep">REP</a> to purchase the <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> in order for this transaction to be successful. Successfully triggering this transaction will move the Market into the next available <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> for the next <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a>. If the caller of this function would like to increase the number of <a href="#stake-token">Stake Tokens</a> he or she has on an outcome other than the one reported by the <a href="#first-reporter">First Reporters</a>, that can be done by passing in an amount greater than 0 for <code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code> equal to the amount of Stake Tokens he or she would like to purchase. Additionally, <code class="prettyprint">_payoutNumerators</code> should be an array of the specific <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> desired, and <code class="prettyprint">_invalid</code> should be set to true or false, depending on whether the caller thinks the market should be resolved as invalid. Alternatively, if the caller does not wish to increase his or her amount of Stake Tokens on a particular outcome, these parameters will be ignored as long as <code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code> is less than 1.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-disputelastreporters-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.disputeLastReporters({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p><code class="prettyprint">disputeLastReporters</code> is used to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a> that has gone through the <a href="#last-report-round">Last Report Round</a> and is <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaiting Finalization</a> in a <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a>. This method purchases a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> for the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code>, who must pay for the Bond using <a href="#rep">REP</a>. Sending this transaction will cause a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>, since this is used to dispute the Last Report Round Proposed Outcome for the Market, which will cause the creation of new <a href="#universe">Universes</a> and cause the current Universe to be <a href="#locked-universe">Locked</a>.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-getorcreatestaketoken-_payoutnumerators-_invalid-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.getOrCreateStakeToken({ _payoutNumerators, _invalid , onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>Returns the Stake Token address for <code class="prettyprint">_payoutNumerators</code> and <code class="prettyprint">_invalid</code> on the <code class="prettyprint">market</code> specified. (If the Stake Token with the specified <code class="prettyprint">payoutNumerators</code> does not exist, it will be created.) When a <a href="#reporter">Reporter</a> submits a <a href="#report">Report</a>, they submit a <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a> (<code class="prettyprint">_payoutNumerators</code>) array indicating how the <a href="#market">Market</a> should payout. Each Payout Set has a Stake Token associated with it, so if two different Reporters submit the same Payout Set as their Report then they will receive the same Stake Token currency. This method will return the Stake Token associated with a specific Payout Set.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-migrateduetonoreports-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.migrateDueToNoReports({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This function is called to move a <a href="#market">Market</a> to the next <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> if no <a href="#report">Reports</a> were submitted for the Market during a <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a>. If a Market is in the <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a> and doesn&rsquo;t receive any Reports, it&rsquo;s moved to the next coming Reporting Window to be Reported on again, however it remains in the First Report Round, however this will be rare as the <a href="#first-report">First Report</a> is incentivized.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-migratethroughallforks-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.migrateThroughAllForks({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction will call <code class="prettyprint">migrateThroughOneFork</code> repeatedly until the <a href="#market">Market</a> has migrated through all of the <a href="#fork">Forks</a> or has reached an active Fork which will throw. See the <code class="prettyprint">migrateThroughOneFork</code> function for a better explanation of what is going on here (the next method).</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-migratethroughonefork-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.migrateThroughOneFork({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction attempts to migrate the <a href="#market">Market</a> into a winning <a href="#child-universe">Child Universe</a> from a <a href="#fork">Forked</a> <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a>. When a Fork occurs, there is a 60 day long <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a> that occurs where in <a href="#rep">REP</a> holders migrate their REP to the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> they want to continue in. Once the Fork Period ends, the Child Universe with the most REP migrated to it will be declared the Winning Universe. Calling <code class="prettyprint">migrateThroughOneFork</code> attempts to move the Market from a Parent Universe to the Winning Universe after it&rsquo;s been decided. This method will throw if the Fork Period isn&rsquo;t over, so there is no Winning Universe to migrate to yet. This will return <code class="prettyprint">1</code> if the <code class="prettyprint">market</code> was successfully migrated and return <code class="prettyprint">0</code> if no migration was required.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-transferownership-market-_newowner-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.transferOwnership({ market, _newOwner, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">transferOwnership</code> transaction will change the current <a href="#market">Market</a> owner to the specified <code class="prettyprint">_newOwner</code>. This is used to transfer ownership of a Market from one address to another. This transaction will fail if the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> isn&rsquo;t the owner of the specified <code class="prettyprint">market</code>. </p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-tryfinalize-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.tryFinalize({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction will attempt to finalize a <a href="#market">Market</a> that is <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaiting Finalization</a>. If the Market isn&rsquo;t Awaiting Finalization then this will fail and return <code class="prettyprint">0</code>. If the Market is Awaiting Finalization and can be finalized then this function will return 1 to indicate that the Market is now finalized and the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> is now the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a>. Further the Tentatively Winning <a href="#payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</a> will become the Winning Payout Distribution Hash.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-updatetentativewinningpayoutdistributionhash-market-_payoutdistributionhash-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.updateTentativeWinningPayoutDistributionHash({ market, _payoutDistributionHash, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This method is used to potentially update the Tentatively Winning <a href="#payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</a>. The Tentatively Winning Payout Distribution Hash is the Payout Distribution Hash with the most <a href="#rep">REP</a> staked on it so far by <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a>. If the <a href="#market">Market</a> is successfully <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> the Tentatively Winning Payout Distribution Hash becomes the Winning Payout Distribution Hash and determines how various <a href="#shares">Shares</a> of <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a> will payout during <a href="#settlement">Settlement</a>. This transaction will not change the Tentative Winning Payout Distribution Hash if the <code class="prettyprint">_payoutDistributionHash</code> submitted to it doesn&rsquo;t have enough REP stakes to overtake the current Tentatively Winning Payout Distribution Hash. Returns <code class="prettyprint">1</code> regardless of if the Tentatively Winning Distribution Hash was changed or not.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-market-withdrawinemergency-market-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Market.withdrawInEmergency({ market, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>If a critical bug or vulnerability is found in Augur, the development team can put it the system into a haulted state until the issue is resolved. In such instances, most regularly-used functions in Augur&rsquo;s backend will become unuseable until the system is returned to its normal state. When this happens, users can call the <code class="prettyprint">withdrawInEmergency</code> function to withdraw their Reputation Tokens from a particular Market.</p>

<p>This transaction will fail if Augur is not currently in a haulted state.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-participationtoken-buy-participationtoken-_attotokens-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.ParticipationToken.buy({ participationToken, _attotokens, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>Purchases the number of participation tokens specified by <code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code>. </p>

<p>This transaction will fail if:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code> is &lt;= 0.</li>
<li>reporting is not currently active in the reporting window.</li>
<li>all markets have not been finalized in the reporting window.</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns: true if the Participation Tokens were successfully purchased. (NOTE: The return value cannot be obtained reliably when calling externally.)</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-participationtoken-redeem-participationtoken-_forgofees-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.ParticipationToken.redeem({ participationToken, _forgoFees, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>Converts the user&rsquo;s Participation Tokens to Reputation Tokens. Due to the fact that Markets can sometimes take months to Finalize (and, therefore, fees can take months to claim), the parameter <code class="prettyprint">forgoFees</code> can be set to true if the user would like to redeem his or her Participation Tokens immediately without having to wait.</p>

<p>This transaction will fail if <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> does not have any Participation Tokens.</p>

<p>It returns true if the Participation Tokens were successfully withdrawn and converted to Reputation Tokens. (NOTE: The return value cannot be obtained reliably when calling externally.)</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-participationtoken-withdrawinemergency-participationtoken-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.ParticipationToken.withdrawInEmergency({ participationToken, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>If a critical bug or vulnerability is found in Augur, the development team can put it the system into a haulted state until the issue is resolved. In such instances, most regularly-used functions in Augur&rsquo;s backend will become unuseable until the system is returned to its normal state. When this happens, users can call the <code class="prettyprint">withdrawInEmergency</code> function to withdraw their Participation Tokens and convert them into Reputation Tokens.</p>

<p>This transaction will fail if Augur is not currently in a haulted state.</p>

<p>It returns true if the Participation Tokens were successfully withdrawn and converted to Reputation Tokens. (NOTE: The return value cannot be obtained reliably when calling externally.)</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-approve-staketoken-_spender-_value-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.approve({ stakeToken, _spender, _value, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>Allows the <code class="prettyprint">_spender</code> the ability to spend up to <code class="prettyprint">_value</code> worth of the specified <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code> for the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code>. This transaction is used to allow another person to perform actions with your Stake Tokens on your behalf. This transaction will spawn an <code class="prettyprint">Approval</code> event which will record a log of the owner&rsquo;s address (<code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code>), <code class="prettyprint">_spender</code> address, and <code class="prettyprint">_value</code> amount approved.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-buy-staketoken-_attotokens-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.buy({ stakeToken, _attotokens, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction is used to purchase Stake Tokens using <a href="#rep">REP</a>. The Stake Token&rsquo;s <a href="#market">Market</a> must be in a <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a> and Stake Tokens can only be purchased during the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> of a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. Stake Tokens have a 1:1 ratio to REP, which means 100 attoREP is equal to 100 attoStakeTokens, so the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> also needs to have at least <code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code> worth of REP to complete this transaction. This transaction will spawn a <code class="prettyprint">Transfer</code> event which will record a log of the from address (<code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code>), to address (<code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code>), and the amount of <code class="prettyprint">_attotokens</code> purchased.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-migratelosingtokens-staketoken-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.migrateLosingTokens({ stakeToken, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction should be called, though it&rsquo;s not required, once on each Stake Token that isn&rsquo;t the Winning Stake Token once a <a href="#market">Market</a> has <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a>. This method will migrate the <a href="#rep">REP</a> used to purchase the non-winning Stake Token to the Winning Stake Token so the REP can be redistributed to the Reporters who correctly staked REP on the Winning <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a>. If this isn&rsquo;t called, then whatever REP is staked into this Stake Token will remain staked into the Stake Token indefinitely. This function will fail to migrate REP to the winning Stake Token if the Market isn&rsquo;t finalized, the Market caused a Fork, or if This Stake Token represents the Winning Payout Set and is therefor not a losing token.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-redeemdisavowedtokens-staketoken-_reporter-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.redeemDisavowedTokens({ stakeToken, _reporter, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>In the event of a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>, all <a href="#market">Markets</a>, except for the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>, that haven&rsquo;t been <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> are placed into a pending state until the <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a> concludes and the Fork is Resolved. During this time, any Stake Tokens purchased for these pending Markets are considered to be &ldquo;Disavowed&rdquo; and are able to be refunded for <a href="#rep">REP</a> back into the <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a> using this transaction. This is an important tool because REP holders are expected to Migrate their REP to a <a href="#child-universe">Child Universe</a> and they need to be able to reclaim their REP to do so. Once the Fork is resolved, all pending markets immediately start <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a>. This will fail if the Stake Token hasn&rsquo;t been &ldquo;Disavowed&rdquo;, or if this is used on a Stake Token belonging to the Forked Market. This transaction will spawn a <code class="prettyprint">Transfer</code> event which will record the from address (<code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code>), to address (<code class="prettyprint">_reporter</code>), and the amount of REP transferred.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-redeemforkedtokens-staketoken-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.redeemForkedTokens({ stakeToken, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction is used to migrate <a href="#rep">REP</a> that is in a <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>. Unlike <code class="prettyprint">redeemDisavowedTokens</code>, which only works on Disavowed <a href="#markets">Markets</a> and withdraws the REP to the <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a>, this transaction only works on the Forked Market and the REP is withdrawn to the <a href="#child-universe">Child Universe</a> corresponding to the Stake Token&rsquo;s <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a>. This transaction will spawn a <code class="prettyprint">Transfer</code> event which will record a log of the from address (the Child Universe&rsquo;s REP contract), to address (<code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code>), and the amount of REP transferred.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-redeemwinningtokens-staketoken-_forgofees-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.redeemWinningTokens({ stakeToken, _forgoFees, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>This transaction is used to redeem <a href="#rep">REP</a> from a winning Stake Token on a <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized Market</a>. Calling this method will withdraw REP based on the amount of REP staked into the Stake Token by the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> as well as a portion of the REP redistributed from losing Stake Tokens. It&rsquo;s recommended that <a href="#reporters">Reporters</a> make sure <code class="prettyprint">migrateLosingTokens</code> was called one time on each of the losing Stake Tokens for this <a href="#market">Market</a> if they wish to claim the a portion of the REP staked in those losing Tokens. This transaction will only succeed if the Market is Finalized, the <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code> is the winning Stake Token, and this isn&rsquo;t a <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>. Due to the fact that Markets can sometimes take months to Finalize (and, therefore, the fees can take months to claim), the parameter <code class="prettyprint">forgoFees</code> can be set to true if the user would like to redeem his or her Stake Tokens immediately without having to wait. This transaction will spawn a <code class="prettyprint">Transfer</code> event which will record a log of the from address (<code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code>), to address (<code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code>), and the amount of <code class="prettyprint">REP</code> transferred.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-transfer-staketoken-_to-_value-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.transfer({ stakeToken, _to, _value, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>The transfer transaction is used to transfer a Stake Token&rsquo;s ownership from the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> to the <code class="prettyprint">_to</code> address provided. This transaction will fail if the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> doesn&rsquo;t own any Stake Tokens at the <code class="prettyprint">stakeToken</code> address provided, or if the <code class="prettyprint">_value</code> provided is greater than the number of Stake Tokens owned by the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code>. This transaction will spawn a <code class="prettyprint">Transfer</code> event which will record a log of the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> address, <code class="prettyprint">_to</code> address, and <code class="prettyprint">_value</code> amount transferred.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-transferfrom-staketoken-_from-_to-_value-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.transferFrom({ stakeToken, _from, _to, _value, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>Unlike transfer, in transferFrom you specify a <code class="prettyprint">_from</code> value as the owner of the Stake Token who will be giving up their ownership to the <code class="prettyprint">_to</code> address provided. This allows Stake Tokens to be completely transferrable and therefor the Staked <a href="#rep">REP</a> contained is also still transferable even while staked on a <a href="#report">Report</a>. This transaction will fail if the <code class="prettyprint">msg.sender</code> doesn&rsquo;t have approval of the <code class="prettyprint">_from</code>, if the <code class="prettyprint">_from</code> address doesn&rsquo;t own any Stake Tokens, or if the <code class="prettyprint">_value</code> provided is more than the Stake Tokens owned by the <code class="prettyprint">_from</code> address. This transaction will also spawn a <code class="prettyprint">Transfer</code> event which will record a log of the <code class="prettyprint">_from</code> address, <code class="prettyprint">_to</code> address, and <code class="prettyprint">_value</code> amount transferred.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-staketoken-withdrawinemergency-staketoken-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.StakeToken.withdrawInEmergency({ stakeToken, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>If a critical bug or vulnerability is found in Augur, the development team can put it the system into a haulted state until the issue is resolved. In such instances, most regularly-used functions in Augur&rsquo;s backend will become unuseable until the system is returned to its normal state. When this happens, users can call the <code class="prettyprint">withdrawInEmergency</code> function to withdraw their Stake Tokens and convert them into Reputation Tokens.</p>

<p>This transaction will fail if Augur is not currently in a haulted state.</p>

<p>It returns true if the Stake Tokens were successfully withdrawn and converted to Reputation Tokens. (NOTE: The return value cannot be obtained reliably when calling externally.)</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-trade-publicbuy-_market-_outcome-_fxpamount-_fxpprice-_tradegroupid-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Trade.publicBuy({ _market, _outcome, _fxpAmount, _fxpPrice, _tradeGroupId, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">publicBuy</code> transaction is used to purchase shares for a specified <code class="prettyprint">_market</code> and <code class="prettyprint">_outcome</code>. The amount of shares you wish to purchase is <code class="prettyprint">_fxpAmount</code> denoted in attoshares and the price point you would like to buy at is <code class="prettyprint">_fxpPrice</code> denoted in attotokens of the <code class="prettyprint">_market</code>&rsquo;s denomination token. This transaction will take orders off the order book that can be filled with this request, otherwise this transaction will create a new order to buy <code class="prettyprint">_fxpAmount</code> of shares at <code class="prettyprint">_fxpPrice</code>. The <code class="prettyprint">_tradeGroupId</code> is an optional argument used by the Augur UI and can be left <code class="prettyprint">undefined</code>. This transaction returns <code class="prettyprint">1</code> if this order was filled completely, or if this order can&rsquo;t be filled immediately an order will be created and the <code class="prettyprint">_orderId</code> of that new order will be returned.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-trade-publicsell-_market-_outcome-_fxpamount-_fxpprice-_tradegroupid-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Trade.publicSell({ _market, _outcome, _fxpAmount, _fxpPrice, _tradeGroupId, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">publicSell</code> transaction is used to purchase shares for a specified <code class="prettyprint">_market</code> and <code class="prettyprint">_outcome</code>. The amount of shares you wish to purchase is <code class="prettyprint">_fxpAmount</code> denoted in attoshares and the price point you would like to sell at is <code class="prettyprint">_fxpPrice</code> denoted in attotokens of the <code class="prettyprint">_market</code>&rsquo;s denomination token. This transaction will take orders off the order book that can be filled with this request, otherwise this transaction will create a new order to sell <code class="prettyprint">_fxpAmount</code> of shares at <code class="prettyprint">_fxpPrice</code>. The <code class="prettyprint">_tradeGroupId</code> is an optional argument used by the Augur UI and can be left <code class="prettyprint">undefined</code>. This transaction returns <code class="prettyprint">1</code> if this order was filled completely, or if this order can&rsquo;t be filled immediately an order will be created and the <code class="prettyprint">_orderId</code> of that new order will be returned.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-trade-publictrade-_direction-_market-_outcome-_fxpamount-_fxpprice-_tradegroupid-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Trade.publicTrade({ _direction, _market, _outcome, _fxpAmount, _fxpPrice, _tradeGroupId, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">publicTrade</code> transaction is works exactly like <code class="prettyprint">publicBuy</code> or <code class="prettyprint">publicSell</code> however a direction must be specified this time. The <code class="prettyprint">_direction</code> must be either <code class="prettyprint">1</code> for buying or <code class="prettyprint">2</code> for selling. This transaction returns <code class="prettyprint">1</code> if this order was filled completely, or if this order can&rsquo;t be filled immediately an order will be created and the <code class="prettyprint">_orderId</code> of that new order will be returned.</p>

<h4 id="augur-api-trade-publictakebestorder-_direction-_market-_outcome-_fxpamount-_fxpprice-_tradegroupid-onsent-onsuccess-onfailed">augur.api.Trade.publicTakeBestOrder({ _direction, _market, _outcome, _fxpAmount, _fxpPrice, _tradeGroupId, onSent, onSuccess, onFailed })</h4>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint">publicTakeBestOrder</code> transaction will work very similarly to <code class="prettyprint">publicTrade</code> except it will not create an order if the request can&rsquo;t be filled. The <code class="prettyprint">_direction</code> must be either <code class="prettyprint">1</code> for buying or <code class="prettyprint">2</code> for selling. This transaction returns the fixed point amount not filled by the order, so <code class="prettyprint">0</code> for a completely filled order, some other number if this request could only be partially filled.</p>

<p>There are a variety of &ldquo;events&rdquo; emitted by the Augur contracts.  Each event is triggered by a user doing something on Augur: submitting a report, closing a <a href="#market">Market</a>, filling an <a href="#open-order">Open Order</a>, etc.</p>

<aside class="notice">The events API described here should not be confused with the (entirely unrelated) concept of &ldquo;events&rdquo; that Reporters Report on.  We think that the concepts are sufficiently different that the context should always make it clear which kind of &ldquo;event&rdquo; is being referred to.  In the event that you encounter an ambiguity, please drop us a note at <a href="mailto:hugs@augur.net">hugs@augur.net</a>, or just violently rage at us on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/augur">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/AugurProject">Twitter</a>!</aside>

<p>The augur.js events API includes event listeners, which notify you of events happening now, and a search function for historical events (&ldquo;logs&rdquo;):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Event listeners</em> (&ldquo;filters&rdquo;) can be turned on using the <code class="prettyprint">augur.filters.listen</code> function.  <code class="prettyprint">augur.filters.listen</code> accepts four arguments: a JSON object containing the contracts and their addresses, a JSON object containing information about each event, an object with event labels as keys (see table below), and callbacks for these events as values.  Each callback has a single argument, an object containing the &ldquo;Data&rdquo; fields shown in the table below.</li>
<li><em>Event search</em> can be accomplished with the <code class="prettyprint">augur.logs.getLogs</code> function.  <code class="prettyprint">augur.logs.getLogs</code> can search for any combination of an event&rsquo;s <em>indexed</em> data fields (enumerated in the table below), and also accepts optional upper- and lower-bound block numbers to further narrow down the search.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table shows the events that can be passed to <code class="prettyprint">augur.filters.listen</code>.  All of these events are optional; if you don&rsquo;t need some of these events for your application, don&rsquo;t include the event in your call to <code class="prettyprint">augur.filters.listen</code>.  In this table, &ldquo;Contract&rdquo; refers to the Ethereum contract on which the event is defined (<a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core">source code</a> / <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-contracts">contract addresses</a>), &ldquo;Data (indexed)&rdquo; refers to fields included in the event log that are searchable using the <code class="prettyprint">augur.logs.getLogs</code> function.</p>

<p>In addition to these on-contract events, <code class="prettyprint">augur.filters.listen</code> also accepts a callback for the <code class="prettyprint">block</code> listener, which fires whenever a new block arrives.  The argument passed to its callback is the hash (as a hex string) of the new block.</p>

<aside class="success">Events are retrieved either via push notification (if connected via websocket) or by polling the Ethereum node (if using HTTP RPC).  If polling, augur.js will check for new events every 6 seconds.</aside>

          <h1 id="tests">Tests</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur">Augur</a> repository, and the middleware <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur.js">augur.js</a> repository both contain tests. Tests are run using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>. Mocha does not need to be installed globally to run the test suites, but if you would like to run specific tests explicitly then it is helpful to globally install Mocha.</p>

<p>To globally install Mocha using <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> you would run the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm install -g mocha</code></p>

<p>To globally install Mocha using <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>, you would run the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn global add mocha</code></p>

<p>Once you have Mocha installed, you can run a specific test case like so:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ mocha ./test/unit/filters/add-filter.js</code></p>

<p>Augur and augur.js both contain their own sets of unit tests and augur.js has a an integration test suite as well. The following sections will provide more details about the differences between the two.</p>

<h2 id="running-tests-in-augur">Running Tests In Augur</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur">Augur</a> has a suite of unit tests that can be run using <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> or <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>. In order to run tests, makes sure you have installed the dependencies for Augur first by using the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm install</code></p>

<p>or if you are using <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn</code></p>

<p>Once you have installed the dependencies for Augur, you can run the following command using <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> to run the unit tests:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm test</code></p>

<p>of if you prefer to use <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>, the command becomes:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn test</code></p>

<p>The Augur repository is also following a set of standard coding rules. In order to check if your code is following the standards, you can run a linting command. To lint the Augur repository using <code class="prettyprint">npm</code>, you would run the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm run lint</code></p>

<p>and to issue the same command with <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>, you would enter this:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn lint</code></p>

<aside class="notice">All pull requests made to the Augur project must be properly linted first and any new functionality added must include tests or updated tests. The Augur team will not accept a pull request that doesn&rsquo;t include updated tests or breaks the linting standards we have for the Augur codebase.</aside>

<h2 id="running-tests-in-augur-js">Running Tests In augur.js</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur.js">augur.js</a> includes both Unit tests and integration tests that can be run with <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> or <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>. In order to run tests, makes sure you have installed the dependencies for augur.js first by using the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm install</code></p>

<p>or if you are using <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code>:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn</code></p>

<p>Once you have installed the dependencies for augur.js, you can run the following command using <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> to run the unit tests:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm run test</code></p>

<p>To run integration tests with <code class="prettyprint">npm</code>, use the following command:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm run integration-test</code></p>

<p>If you would prefer to use <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code> the command to run unit tests becomes:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn test</code></p>

<p>to run integration tests, the command is:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn integration-test</code></p>

<p>augur.js also follows a standard for it&rsquo;s code and also has a linting command. The command using <code class="prettyprint">npm</code> is:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ npm run lint</code></p>

<p>And if you prefer <code class="prettyprint">yarn</code> then the command is:</p>

<p><code class="prettyprint">$ yarn lint</code></p>

<aside class="notice">All pull requests made to the augur.js project must be properly linted first and any new functionality added must include tests or updated tests.

</ol>

<p>Modules with a single export should have that denoted as <code class="prettyprint">default</code>.
If the export is a function, it should be anonymous.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>All components should be semantically tagged, highly reusable, and DRY. Components should have comments for functionality that may be non-obvious, depend on other methods, requires a complex mutation/filer, etc.</p>

<p>To help ensure this, the following conventions have been employed:</p>

<h4 id="layout-conventions">Layout Conventions:</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight html"><code><span class="c">&lt;!-- JSX Layout Conventions --&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- Example Component tree (after rendering)--&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- only one main tag in the whole app, currently in app.jsx --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;main</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"app"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- each view has it's own section component --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;section</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"create-market-view"</span> <span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- each view has reusable components which should be articles
  unless they are specifically a button, list, link, etc.--&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;article&gt;</span>
      <span class="c">&lt;!-- more reusable components may be inside --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/article&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- ....more reusable components --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/main&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There is only one <code class="prettyprint">main</code> tag, which is currently employed in the <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/blob/master/src/modules/app/components/app.jsx">app.jsx</a> component, to contain all view content. All top-level components (i.e. - views) should be contained within a <code class="prettyprint">section</code> tag. Though valid, <code class="prettyprint">section</code> should only be used for view level components. All <code class="prettyprint">section</code> tags should have an accompanying <code class="prettyprint">id</code> attribute (excluding unique semantic tags (main, header, footer, etc.)). All reusable components should be contained within an <code class="prettyprint">article</code> tag unless this use would be semantically incorrect; in which case, use whatever tag is appropriate. All components should be standard HTML5 elements with their default behaviors intact. (<em>Note: Due to some implementation constraints, there may be a reason to deviate from this, but it should be dialoged over prior to implementation.</em>)</p>

<p>Props that are being passed to a component should be explicit from both ends and Prop validations should have required props first, optional props after.</p>

<p>Null component states (ex: &lsquo;no markets&rsquo;, &#39;no tags&rsquo;, etc.) should always be shown as the <code class="prettyprint">false</code> value for a conditional display. Conditional display should occur as far down the component tree as possible.</p>

<h4 id="detailed-component-conventions">Detailed Component Conventions</h4>

<p>Not all conventions are detailed above, but rather just the main points.
For a full review of the breadth of the conventions employed, reference:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="prettyprint">.eslintrc</code> - JS linting rules are found <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/blob/master/.eslintrc">here</a>.</li>
<li><code class="prettyprint">.editorconfig</code> - Editor focused rules to keep coding styles consistent. Can be found <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/blob/master/.editorconfig">here</a>.</li>
<li>Optional and primarily for convenience, but the linting enforces many of these conventions</li>

<p>All styles should be contextual such that styling rules are only directly applied to the immediately relevant component(s), with the ultimate goal always being consistency and maintainability. This is seen reflected in the overall structure of the stylesheets &ndash; generally a 1-to-1 between a component and a stylesheet.</p>

<p>The full breadth of Less&rsquo;s functionality is permissible. If you need a Less variable to be accessible during runtime, create a rule set for <code class="prettyprint">body</code> and with identically named custom properties which have their values as the respective less variables.  You can then get these values by calling <code class="prettyprint">getComputedStyle</code> and <code class="prettyprint">getPropertyValue</code> on <code class="prettyprint">document.body</code>.</p>

<p>Following are some of the conventions that have been employed:</p>

<h4 id="component-style-conventions">Component Style Conventions</h4>

<p>Every component should have the minimum amount of styling required (helps maintain contextualization). This allows for stylesheets of parent components that employ a component to apply any additional &#39;chrome&rsquo; required.</p>

<p>Things to remember about Component Less styling include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mixin inclusions should always come first within a declaration block and be alphabetical.</li>
<li>Classnames should be contextual, non-generic, and should be discrete words delimited by a <code class="prettyprint">-</code> (dash).</li>
<li>IDs should be discrete words delimited by an <code class="prettyprint">_</code> (underscore).</li>
<li>Flexbox should be utilized for all layout (exceptions would be something like a fixed element, but that should be very rare).</li>
<li>Avoid the use of <code class="prettyprint">!important</code> unless absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>All external borders (parent level components within a view) should be the normal border color. All internal borders should be either muted or light (depending on the application).</li>
<li>When utilizing <code class="prettyprint">CSSTransitionGroup</code>, styling of this wrapper should be housed within the rendered child&rsquo;s stylesheet</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="detailed-style-conventions">Detailed Style Conventions</h4>

<p>Above are the main points, but additional structural and styling conventions of the stylesheets themselves are enforced through linting.
For a full review of all conventions, reference:</p>

          <h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>

<aside class="notice">The Glossary section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don&rsquo;t worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>

<!--
this section will include subsections for all terms used and descriptions of what they are and what they do. This is to avoid repeating them same information over and over again in function descriptions in the API section. This section should be easy to navigate and easy to link to specific concepts. To that end, each concept should have its own subsection.

Goals:
  - Easy to navigate
    - every term has its own "section" for easy linking
    - alphabetical
  - Human Readable language
 -->

<p>This section of the documentation is dedicated to terms found and used throughout the rest of documentation. Below you will find sections about terms used in Augur. The goal is to explain everything that might be confusing in an easy to understand way.</p>

<h2 id="ask-order">Ask Order</h2>

<p>An Ask Order is an <a href="#order">Order</a> indicating the desire of the <a href="#order-creator">Order Creator</a> to sell <a href="#shares">Shares</a> of one or more <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a>. This is the opposite of a <a href="#bid-order">Bid Order</a>.</p>

<h2 id="atto-prefix">Atto- (Prefix)</h2>

<p>Atto- is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of 10^−18, or 0.000000000000000001.  This prefix is used for a number of terms in Augur, including attoETH, attoREP, attoshares, attotoken, etc.</p>

<h2 id="bid-order">Bid Order</h2>

<p>A Bid Order is an <a href="#order">Order</a> indicating the desire of the <a href="#order-creator">Order Creator</a> to buy <a href="#shares">Shares</a> of one or more <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a>. This is the opposite of an <a href="#ask-order">Ask Order</a>.</p>

<h2 id="binary-market">Binary Market</h2>

<p>A Binary Market is a <a href="#market">market</a> with only two <a href="#outcome">outcomes</a>, as well as Indeterminate which is always a possible outcome. Binary markets are for yes or no questions, if you need more than a yes or no then a <a href="#categorical-market">Categorical</a> or <a href="#scalar-market">Scalar</a> Market might fit your needs better.</p>

<h2 id="categorical-market">Categorical Market</h2>

<p>A Categorical Market is a <a href="#market">market</a> with more than 2 potential <a href="#outcome">outcomes</a>, but no more than 8. As with all markets, Indeterminate is also an outcome not included in the 8 outcome maximum. Categorical Markets are best for multiple choice type questions, which team wins a tournament or what color tie the President of the United States wears at his next press conference. If you just need a yes or no question, you will probably want to make a <a href="#binary-market">Binary Market</a>. If you wanted to guess the temperature in degrees on a certain day, you would probably want to use a <a href="#scalar-market">Scalar Market</a> for that, as it would be very difficult to pin down 8 possibilities and it&rsquo;s not a yes or no question.</p>

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>Challenge is used to describe the act of a <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder posting a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to dispute or &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</a> before it is <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a>.</p>

<h2 id="child-universe">Child Universe</h2>

<p>A Child Universe is a <a href="#universe">Universe</a> created after a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>. Child Universes have a <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a> which is the Universe that had the Fork happen on it. <a href="#locked-universe">Locked Universes</a> always have Child Universes because a Fork causes the Universe to be locked which then causes the creation of new Universes which are considered Children of the original, and now Locked, Universe.</p>

<h2 id="complete-set">Complete Set</h2>

<p>A Complete Set is a collection of <a href="#shares">Shares</a> in every <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a>. Complete Sets are created when the <a href="#order-creator">Creator</a> and <a href="#order-filler">Filler</a> of an <a href="#order">Order</a> both use currency to pay for the trade, as opposed to one or both parties using Shares to complete the trade. When both parties use shares to complete a trade then a Complete Set will be formed and settled (destroyed). The cost in <a href="#atto-prefix">attoETH</a> of a Complete Set for a particular <a href="#market">Market</a> is determined by the <a href="#number-of-ticks">Number of Ticks</a> for that Market. When Complete Sets are <a href="#settlement">Settled</a>, <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a> are extracted from the value of the Complete Set and are paid proportionally by both parties, so if you are going to get a larger payout from Settlement you will also pay the lions share of the fees. The Settlement Fees extracted will go toward paying for the reporting system, in the form of a <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting fee</a>, and paying the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> their set <a href="#trading-fee">Creator Fee</a> from Share Settlement.</p>

<h2 id="creator-fee">Creator Fee</h2>

<p>A Creator Fee is set by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> when he or she creates a new <a href="#market">Market</a>. Once the Creator Fee is set, it cannot be changed. The Creator Fee must be between 0% and 50%. The Creator Fee and the <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fee</a> are both extracted at the same time whenever <a href="#shares">Shares</a> are <a href="#settlement">Settled</a>. Shares can be Settled when a user sells a <a href="#complete-set">Complete Set</a> or when the Market has been <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> and a user wants to close an open <a href="#position">Position</a>. The Creator Fee is designed to incentivize users to make popular Markets as they stand to earn money if enough people trade on the Market. They can then recoup their market creation cost and ideally turn a profit on posting interesting Markets. The <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a> are discussed in more details in the <a href="#trading">Trading</a> section of the documentation.</p>

<h2 id="designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</h2>

<p>The Designated Dispute Phase is a three (3) day period immediately following a <a href="#report">Reported</a> <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> by an <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> during the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a>. During this time, any <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder can post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the Proposed Outcome of the <a href="#market">Market</a>, which moves the Market into the next available <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> for a <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a>, specifically the <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a>. If a Dispute Bond is not posted during the Designated Dispute Phase then the Market is <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> and the Proposed Outcome becomes the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a>. The Designated Dispute Phase has identical rules to a Reporting Window&rsquo;s <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> with the one exception being that an Designated Dispute Phase is not part of a Reporting Window.</p>

<h2 id="designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</h2>

<p>The Designated Report Phase is up to three (3) days in length and begins immediately following the <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a>. During this time the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> is expected to <a href="#report">Report</a> a <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> for the Market. When the Designated Reporter submits his/her/its response the Market will immediately enter an <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a>. If the Designated Reporter fails to Report on the Market within the Designated Report Phase then the <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</a> is lost and applied to the First Reporter&rsquo;s stake and the Market is moved into the next available <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> for a <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a>. The Designated Report Phase should not be confused with a Reporting Window&rsquo;s <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> which is longer and only concerns <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a>.</p>

<h2 id="designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</h2>

<p>An Designated Reporter is a single address designated to submit the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> for a <a href="#market">Market</a> during <a href="#designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</a>. The Designated Reporter is set by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> during Market Creation. All Markets must have a Designated Reporter.</p>

<h2 id="designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</h2>

<p>Designated Reporting is the first and fastest way that a <a href="#market">Market</a> can be <a href="#report">Reported</a> on. One address will be responsible for submitting a <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> for the Market and will have 3 days to do so after a Market&rsquo;s <a href="#end-time">End Time</a>, known as the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a>. After the Report has been submit by the Designated <a href="#reporter">Reporter</a> then a 3 day <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a> begins where in any <a href="#rep">REP</a> Holder can <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</a>. If the <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> is posted then the Market is moved into the next <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> and will be subject to <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a>. Designated Reporting is independent of Reporting Windows.</p>

<h2 id="dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</h2>

<p>A Dispute Bond is a bond posted to force another round of <a href="#report">Reporting</a> if a <a href="#reporter">Reporter</a> feels the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</a> isn&rsquo;t accurate. If the <a href="#market">Market&rsquo;s</a> Proposed Outcome is changed in the forced round of reporting then the poster of the dispute bond will get their money back for successfully challenging the false <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of the Market.</p>

<h2 id="dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</h2>

<p>A Dispute Phase is a three (3) day window after a <a href="#market">Market</a> has been <a href="#report">Reported</a> on before which the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> becomes the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a>. During this 3 day period, a <a href="#rep">REP</a> Holder can post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> if they would like to force another round of Reporting for the Market. The Market will be moved into the next <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. Markets in the Dispute Phase are referred to as <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Markets Awaiting Finalization</a>.</p>

<h2 id="end-time">End Time</h2>

<p>End Time is the date and time that a <a href="#market">Market</a>&rsquo;s event will have come to pass and should be known. After this date and time has passed the Market will get <a href="#report">Reported</a> on and <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fill-order">Fill Order</h2>

<p>Filling an <a href="#order">Order</a> is when a <a href="#order-filler">Filler</a> provides what the <a href="#order-creator">Creator</a> of the order is seeking in their order. If a Filler only provides some of what the Creator wants then it&rsquo;s known as a partial fill. If the Filler provides exactly what the Creator requests then it&rsquo;s known as completely filling the order.</p>

<h2 id="final-outcome">Final Outcome</h2>

<p>A Final Outcome is a <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> that is not <a href="#challenge">Challenged</a> through a <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> and the <a href="#market">Market</a> becomes <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a>. A Market&rsquo;s Final Outcome cannot be challenged or changed.</p>

<h2 id="finalized-market">Finalized Market</h2>

<p>A Finalized Market is a <a href="#market">Market</a> that has <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaited Finalization</a> and has not been disputed, the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> is now considered final. This market will now allow <a href="#shares">Share</a> holders to <a href="#settlement">settle</a> their shares with the market.</p>

<h2 id="first-report">First Report</h2>

<p>The First Report is simply the first <a href="#report">Report</a> placed on a <a href="#market">Market</a>. The First Report generally will come from the <a href="#designed-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> for the Market, which would immediately refund the <a href="#designated-report-no-show-gas-bond">Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond</a> and <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</a> to the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a>. In the event a Designated Reporter fails to Report then the Market is moved into the next available <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>, along with the <a href="#designated-report-no-show-gas-bond">Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond</a> and <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</a>, for it&rsquo;s <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a>. The first person to submit a Report and Stake at least 0 <a href="#rep">REP</a> on their Report will have the <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</a> added to their Stake and their Report transaction&rsquo;s GAS cost covered by the <a href="#designated-report-no-show-gas-bond">Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond</a>. This provides an incentive to submit the First Report as the <a href="#first-reporter">First Reporter</a> stands to gain the Designated Report No-Show REP Bond in REP if they Stake on the eventual <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a>.</p>

<h2 id="designated-report-no-show-gas-bond">Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond</h2>

<p>The Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond is paid for using ETH by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> during Market Creation. This Bond is completely refunded to the Market Creator as soon as the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> submits a <a href="#report">Report</a> during the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a>. This Bond is used in the event of a Designated Reporter failing to submit a Report during the Designated Report Phase. The <a href="#market">Market</a>, as well as the <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</a> and this Bond, are moved into the next <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> for <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a>, starting with the <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a>. During the First Report Round the <a href="#first-reporter">First Reporter</a>&rsquo;s transaction to submit the <a href="#first-report">First Report</a> on this Market is paid for using the Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond. If the transaction costs less than the amount of the Designated Report No-Show Gas Bond then the remaining ETH is sent to the First Reporter.</p>

<h2 id="designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</h2>

<p>The Designated Report No-Show REP Bond is paid for using <a href="#rep">REP</a> by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> during Market Creation. The Bond is refunded to the Market Creator if the <a href="#designed-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> submits a <a href="#report">Report</a> during the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a>. If the Designated Reporter fails to Report during the Designated Report Phase then the Designated Report No-Show REP Bond is applied to the stake of the First Reporter for this <a href="#market">Market</a> in the <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a> during the next available <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. This actually allows for someone to stake 0 REP for the <a href="#first-report">First Report</a> because the Bond is added to whatever is staked. This means someone without any REP has the potential to Report and if the Market is eventually <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> the way that person Reported then they can earn REP without having to buy it.</p>

<h2 id="first-report-round">First Report Round</h2>

<p>The First Report Round is the first <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a> a <a href="#market">Market</a> will go through if it requires Reporting Rounds to be <a href="#market-resolution">Resolved</a>.</p>

<h2 id="first-reporter">First Reporter</h2>

<p>The First Reporter is the person who submits the <a href="#first-report">First Report</a> on a <a href="#market">Market</a>. Generally the First Reporter will be the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a>, however if the Designated Reporter fails to <a href="#report">Report</a> then the First Reporter will become whoever submits the First Report during the <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a> for this Market.</p>

<h2 id="fork">Fork</h2>

<p>A Fork occurs if a <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</a> from an <a href="#last-report-round">Last Report Round</a> of <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a> is <a href="#dispute-bond">Disputed</a>. A Fork causes Augur to create multiple <a href="#universe">Universes</a> of itself. Each Universe is empty except for the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>. There will be a Universe created for each possible <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of the <a href="#market">Market</a>, including invalid, and the Markets will be <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> on each Universe. <a href="#rep">REP</a> holders will need to choose which Universe they want to migrate their REP tokens too. Migration is one way and final. After sixty (60) days the <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a> ends and the Universe with the most REP migrated too it will allow traders to <a href="#settlement">Settle</a> <a href="#shares">Shares</a> for the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a> and <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fees</a> will be paid out to <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a> for that Universe only. The original Universe that contained the Forked Market is known as the <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universe</a> and is considered <a href="#locked-universe">Locked</a>. All of the new Universes created are known as <a href="#child-universe">Child Universes</a>. Forking will result in a new REP Token contract belonging to each Child Universe spawned by the Fork.</p>

<h2 id="fork-period">Fork Period</h2>

<p>The Fork Period is a sixty (60) day period of time after a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> has occurred.</p>

<h2 id="forked-market">Forked Market</h2>

<p>A Forked Market is a <a href="#market">Market</a> who&rsquo;s <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> after a <a href="#last-report-round">Last Report Round</a> is <a href="#dispute-bond">Disputed</a> and causes a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> to occur. A Fork will cause the creation of multiple <a href="#universe">Universes</a> of Augur with the Forked Market having a different <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> in each Universe. The Universe that contained the Forked Market originally will become a <a href="#locked-universe">Locked Universe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="last-report-round">Last Report Round</h2>

<p>The Last Report Round is the final <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a> in which a <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> to the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> during the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> will result in a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> instead of another Reporting Round. Unlike previous Reporting Rounds, when a <a href="#market">Market</a> in the Last Report Round enters the Dispute Phase and it&rsquo;s Proposed Outcome is Challenged then the Market becomes a <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a> and the <a href="#universe">Universe</a> becomes a <a href="#locked-universe">Locked Universe</a>.</p>

<h2 id="locked-universe">Locked Universe</h2>

<p>A Locked Universe is a <a href="#universe">Universe</a> that had a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> occur within it and no longer allows the creation of new <a href="#markets">Markets</a>. All Markets within a Locked Universe remain tradable, as Markets never stop being tradable, even after <a href="#finalized-market">Finalizing</a>. <a href="#rep">REP</a> holders within a Locked Universe are given a one time and final option to migrate their REP to one of the new universes created after a Fork locks a Market. There is no time constraint to how long a REP holder is allowed to wait to choose a Universe to migrate their REP to.</p>

<h2 id="market-creator-mailbox">Market Creator Mailbox</h2>

<p>A Market Creator Mailbox is an address that belongs to the <a href="#market-creator">Creator</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a>. All of the fees that a Market Creator can collect (whether as ETH or as tokens) get sent to this address, where the Creator can then withdraw them. Funds that are potentially refunded to the Market creator (such as <a href="#validity-bond">Validity Bonds</a>, <a href="#designated-report-no-show-gas-bond">Designated Report No-Show Gas Bonds</a>, and <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bonds</a>) are also sent to the Market Creator Mailbox.</p>

<h2 id="market">Market</h2>

<p>A Market is created by users of Augur for a small fee. They are used to describe an upcoming event that people would presumably be interested in wagering on. They should also provide information on how to verify the <a href="#outcome">outcome</a> of the event, the more specific the better. Each Market created on the Augur network will have an automatically managed <a href="#order-book">Order Book</a>, which will allow users to buy and sell <a href="#shares">Shares</a> of different outcomes of the Market. The <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> can set the <a href="#creator-fee">Creator Fee</a> for the Market, which once set cannot be raised, which will determine their cut of all shares <a href="#settlement">Settled</a> on the Market. The Market Creator also needs to specify a <a href="#maximum-display-price">Max Price</a> and a <a href="#minimum-display-price">Min Price</a> as well as the <a href="#tick">Number of Ticks</a> for the Market. There are three different Market types supported by Augur, they are: <a href="#binary-market">Binary</a>, <a href="#categorical-market">Categorical</a>, and <a href="#scalar-market">Scalar</a>.</p>

<h2 id="market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</h2>

<p>Market Awaiting Finalization occurs when a <a href="#market">Market</a> has been <a href="#report">Reported</a> on and has a <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a>. Market&rsquo;s await finalization for a period of 3 days, which is the length of the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a>, in which <a href="#rep">REP</a> Holders are allowed to post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to force another round of reporting for the Market Awaiting Finalization. If a Market&rsquo;s Proposed Outcome is not <a href="#challenge">Challenged</a> for 3 days it becomes a <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized Market</a> and can no longer be Challenged.</p>

<h2 id="market-creator">Market Creator</h2>

<p>A Market Creator is a user who created a <a href="#market">Market</a>. They are charged a small fee to make a new Market but can determine the <a href="#creator-fee">Creator Fee</a> for <a href="#settlement">Settlement</a> of <a href="#shares">Shares</a> on that Market. Market Creators are incentivized to create popular Markets so as to generate the most amount of <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a> for themselves. Other information a Market requires is the actual question being purposed, the type of Market, the number of <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a>, <a href="#end-time">End Time</a>, and a <a href="#topic">Topic</a>.</p>

<h2 id="market-resolution">Market Resolution</h2>

<p>Market Resolution is the process of <a href="#finalized-market">Finalizing</a> a <a href="#market">Market</a>. <a href="#designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</a>, <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a> and <a href="#fork">Forks</a> are all examples of attempts at Market Resolution.</p>

<h2 id="maximum-display-price">Maximum Display Price</h2>

<p>The Maximum Display Price (often seen as <code class="prettyprint">maxDisplayPrice</code>) is the maximum price allowed for a share on a <a href="#market">market</a>. For <a href="#binary-market">Binary</a> or <a href="#categorical-market">Categorical</a> Markets this value is always 1, as in 1 ETH. <a href="#scalar-market">Scalar</a> markets&rsquo; Maximum Display Price would be the top end of the range set by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-display-price">Minimum Display Price</h2>

<p>The Minimum Display Price (often seen as <code class="prettyprint">minDisplayPrice</code>) is the minimum price allowed for a share on a <a href="#market">market</a>. For <a href="#binary-market">Binary</a> or <a href="#categorical-market">Categorical</a> Markets this value is always 0, as in 0 ETH. <a href="#scalar-market">Scalar</a> markets&rsquo; Minimum Display Price would be the bottom end of the range set by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a>.</p>

<h2 id="number-of-ticks">Number of Ticks</h2>

<p>The Number of Ticks can be thought of as the number of possible prices, or <a href="#tick">Ticks</a>, between <a href="#minimum-display-price">Minimum Price</a> and <a href="#maximum-display-price">Maximum Price</a> for a <a href="#market">Market</a>. It&rsquo;s also the amount of <a href="#atto-prefix">attoETH</a> required to purchase a single <a href="#complete-set">Complete Set</a> of indivisible <a href="#shares">Shares</a> for a Market. When Shares are <a href="#settlement">Settled</a> then each Complete Set will yield Number of Ticks <a href="#atto-prefix">attoETH</a>. The yield from the Complete Sets Settlement is what <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a> are extracted from prior to paying out traders for their closed <a href="#position">Positions</a>. Settlement Fees are paid proportionally so that the trader set to receive more payout will have to pay more Fees. The price of an Order can be set to anywhere between 0 and the <a href="#number-of-ticks">Number of Ticks</a> set for the Market.</p>

<h2 id="open-order">Open Order</h2>

<p>An Open Order is an <a href="#order">Order</a> that is currently on the <a href="#order-book">Order Book</a> and has not been completely <a href="#fill-order">Filled</a>.</p>

<h2 id="order">Order</h2>

<p>An Order can be thought of as the recorded interest of a user to execute a trade of some amount of <a href="#shares">Shares</a> at a defined price point. Orders come in two types, <a href="#bid-order">Bid Orders</a> and <a href="#ask-order">Ask Orders</a>, which indicate an attempt to buy or sell respectively. The <a href="#order-creator">Creator</a> of the order will also need to escrow currency or shares in order to provide their half of the trade. The information stored in an Order is as follows: the type of order, the <a href="#market">Market</a> the order is trading on, the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> the order is concerned with buying or selling, the Order Creator&rsquo;s address, the price per share, the amount of shares to trade, what block number the order was created during, the amount of currency or Shares escrowed in the order by the Order Creator for their half of the trade.</p>

<h2 id="order-book">Order Book</h2>

<p>The Order Book is the collection of all <a href="#open-order">Open Orders</a> currently available for a <a href="#market">Market</a>. <a href="#order">Orders</a> are placed on the order book by <a href="#order-creator">Order Creators</a> and are <a href="#fill-order">Filled</a> by <a href="#order-filler">Order Fillers</a>. Orders are divided up by which type, or side, of order they are <a href="#bid-order">Bid</a> or <a href="#ask-order">Ask</a>. Orders are further divided up by <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a>.</p>

<h2 id="order-creator">Order Creator</h2>

<p>An Order Creator is the person who places an <a href="#order">Order</a> on the <a href="#order-book">Order Book</a>. They escrow currency or <a href="#shares">Shares</a> into their Order to buy or sell Shares of an <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a>.</p>

<h2 id="order-filler">Order Filler</h2>

<p>An Order Filler either partially or fully <a href="#fill-order">Fills</a> an <a href="#open-order">Open Order</a> on the <a href="#order-book">Order Book</a>. Order Fillers send currency or <a href="#shares">Shares</a> to fill the Open Order and complete their half of the trade described in the <a href="#order">Order</a>.</p>

<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>

<p>An outcome is a potential result of a <a href="#market">Market</a>&rsquo;s future event. For example, a market with a question of &ldquo;Will it rain anywhere in New York City on November 1st, 2032 as reported by www.weather.com?&rdquo; would have three potential <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a>: Yes, No, and Invalid. Invalid would be an option if the world blew up before November 1st, 2032 and there was no New York City or www.weather.com to verify the Market&rsquo;s Outcome. More realistically this can happen for markets that have too vague of a question. A good example of a vague market that would most likely be voted invalid would be &ldquo;Does God exist?&rdquo; as no one has a definitive answer.</p>

<h2 id="parent-universe">Parent Universe</h2>

<p>A Parent Universe is a <a href="#universe">Universe</a> that has spawned <a href="#child-universe">Child Universes</a> because a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> had occurred on the Parent Universe and caused it to make new Universes. In other words, <a href="#locked-universe">Locked Universes</a> are Parent Universes to the Universes created due to the Fork.</p>

<h2 id="participation-token">Participation Token</h2>

<p>Participation Tokens are used to determine how reporting fees are divided up. The more Participation Tokens a user buys (purchased with REP), the larger his or her share of the fees. The user gets back that REP after fees are distributed, so it essentially acts like a deposit. It&rsquo;s a way of encouraging <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a> to be active in the platform even when they&rsquo;re not needed, so they&rsquo;ll be around when they are needed. Buying Participation Tokens is not required. Participation Tokens can be purchased anytime before a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> ends. They are only used in the case that only <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporters</a> are needed for reporting (everyone shows up) and no one disputes the Designated Reporters. Participation Tokens are purchased after all <a href="#market">Markets</a> in the Reporting Window have finalized.</p>

<h2 id="payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</h2>

<p>The Payout Distribution Hash is a sha3 hash of the <a href="#payout-set">Payout Set</a>. When a <a href="#market">Market</a> is <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaiting Finalization</a> it is said to have a tentative Winning Payout Distribution Hash. Once the Market is Finalized then the tentative hash becomes the Winning Payout Distribution Hash. Payout Distribution Hashes of <a href="#forked-markets">Forked Markets</a> are used as identifiers for <a href="#child-universe">Child Universes</a> and <a href="#parent-universe">Parent Universes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="payout-set">Payout Set</h2>

<p>A Payout Set, sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;Payout Numerator&rdquo; in contract methods, is an array with a length equal to the number of <a href="#outcome">Outcomes</a> for a <a href="#market">Market</a>. Each value in the Array is required to be 0 or a positive number that does not exceed the <a href="#number-of-ticks">Number of Ticks</a> for the Market. Further, the total sum of all the values contained within the Payout Set array should be equaled to the Number of Ticks for the Market. A quick example, on a <a href="#binary-market">Binary Market</a> with 1000 <a href="#tick">Ticks</a>, if we wanted to submit a <a href="#report">Report</a> that stakes <a href="#rep">REP</a> on Outcome <code class="prettyprint">0</code>, we would submit a Payout Set that looks like this <code class="prettyprint">[1000, 0]</code>. Payout Sets are a breakdown of how Markets should payout, or the Payout Distribution, when <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a>, so in the above example, only shares of Outcome <code class="prettyprint">0</code> will payout on the Finalized Market. Valid Payout Sets are hashed using sha3, and becomes a <a href="#payout-distribution-hash">Payout Distribution Hash</a>.</p>

<h2 id="position">Position</h2>

<p>A Position is the amount of <a href="#share">Shares</a> that is owned (a long position) or borrowed and then sold (a short position) by an individual. A position can be profitable or unprofitable, depending on <a href="#market">Market</a> movements. Positions can be Open or Closed. An Open Position simply means you currently own the shares, where as a closed position means you have now redeemed your shares and have cashed out for currency. Closing a short positions means you are buying the Shares of the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> you are short on, where as closing a long position means selling the Shares you own.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</h2>

<p>The Proposed Outcome is the currently reported <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> for a <a href="#market">Market</a> that is <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaiting Finalization</a>. In other words, it&rsquo;s the outcome <a href="#reporters">Reporters</a> have staked their <a href="#rep">REP</a> on to indicate that it is the correct Outcome of the Market. If a Market isn&rsquo;t <a href="#challenge">Challenged</a> while Awaiting Finalization by a REP holder posting a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> then the Market will become <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized</a> and the Prosed Outcome will become a <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rep">REP</h2>

<p>REP, also known as Reputation, Reputation Tokens, or REP Tokens, is the currency used by the Augur Decentralized Oracle System. REP is used to stake on a <a href="#report">Report</a> on the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a>, Pay the <a href="#designated-report-no-show-rep-bond">Designated Report No-Show REP Bond</a> in order to create a Market, and to purchase a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</a>. During the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> of a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> is where most REP holders will be using their REP to Report. You will be asked to stake REP on an Outcome based on how confident you are in that Outcome being the result of the Market. The Markets you will see during a Reporting Window are all past their <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> and the Outcome should be determinable. If the outcome is not determinable you can Report it as Invalid. The more REP you stake, the larger the share of the <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fees</a> you will receive if you Report with the consensus. The two bonds purchased by REP, Dispute Bonds and the Designated Report No-Show REP Bond, are both fully refunded to the bond placer if things go smoothly. So the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> immediately gets their REP bond back if the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> does Report during the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a>. Dispute Bonds are refunded to the Dispute Bond Owner if the Market&rsquo;s Proposed Outcome is changed from the one Challenged.</p>

<h2 id="report">Report</h2>

<p>A Report, or Reporting, is the staking of <a href="#rep">REP</a> on the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a> that&rsquo;s passed its <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> by a <a href="#reporter">Reporter</a>. The staking of REP is the act of Reporting. Reporting as a term can be used to describe the act of submitting a report for a single market or a number of markets. Reporting takes place during a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. For a detailed breakdown of the Reporting System in Augur, see the <a href="#reporting">Reporting Section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reporter">Reporter</h2>

<p>A Reporter is a <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder who
Stakes REP on the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of a <a href="#market">Market</a> who&rsquo;s <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> has come to pass and is <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaiting Finalization</a>. A <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> is assigned by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> during Market Creation for <a href="#designated-reporting">Designated Reporting</a>. REP holders will need to wait for a Market to enter a <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a> of a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> in order to <a href="#report">Report</a> on the Outcome of the Market. Reporters are expected to Report accurately as the Market&rsquo;s event should have come to pass and the result should be known. To incentivize this, reporters who stake on the non <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> will lose their stake to the Reporters who did correctly Stake their REP on the Final Outcome.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-fee">Reporting Fee</h2>

<p>The Reporting Fee is used to help pay for Augur&rsquo;s Decentralized Oracle System. When <a href="#shares">Shares</a> are <a href="#settlement">Settled</a> (aka destroyed), before paying out to the share holders Augur will extract the <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a>, which includes the <a href="#creator-fee">Creator Fee</a> and the Reporting Fee. The Reporting Fee is sent to the <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> that contains the <a href="#market">Market</a> being traded on, and are later used to pay <a href="#rep">REP</a> holders for <a href="#report">Reporting</a> on the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of Markets.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-period">Reporting Period</h2>

<p>The Reporting Period is combined time of the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> and <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> of a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a>. In other words, it&rsquo;s a term used to describe the total duration of a Reporting Window.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</h2>

<p>The Reporting Phase occurs in the first twenty seven (27) days of a [Reporting Window]. During this phase, <a href="#market">Markets</a> in <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Rounds</a> are <a href="#report">Reported</a> on by <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a>. Following a Reporting Phase the Market should receive a Report to set a <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> and be moved into a <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> during which the Market is considered to be <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Awaiting Finalization</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-round">Reporting Round</h2>

<p>Reporting Rounds take place in a <a href="#reporting-window">Reporting Window</a> during which <a href="#rep">REP</a> holders Stake REP on the <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of <a href="#market">Markets</a> currently in a Reporting Round. Markets enter Reporting Rounds if the <a href="#designated-reporter">Designated Reporter</a> fails to <a href="#report">Report</a> during the <a href="#designated-report-phase">Designated Report Phase</a> or if the Designated Reporter&rsquo;s <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> is <a href="#challenge">Challenged</a> during the <a href="#designated-dispute-phase">Designated Dispute Phase</a>. Markets start in the <a href="#first-report-round">First Report Round</a> which incentivizes a <a href="#first-report">First Report</a> if the Market hasn&rsquo;t received a Report from the Designated Reporter but otherwise acts like any other Reporting Round. Reporting Rounds last the entirety of a Reporting Window and if the Market&rsquo;s Proposed Outcome is Challenged during the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a> of the Reporting Window, it is moved up to the next level of Reporting Rounds until eventually reaching the <a href="#last-report-round">Last Report Round</a>. A Challenge of the Proposed Outcome following a Last Report Round will cause a <a href="#fork">Fork</a> to occur.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-window">Reporting Window</h2>

<p>The Reporting Window is a period of 30 days in which <a href="#markets">Markets</a> that have passed their <a href="#end-time">End Time</a> are expected to be <a href="#report">Reported</a> on by <a href="#reporter">Reporters</a>. Reporting Windows last for thirty (30) days and consist of two (2) phases, the <a href="#reporting-phase">Reporting Phase</a> and the <a href="#dispute-phase">Dispute Phase</a>. The combined duration of the Reporting Phase and the Dispute Phase is known as the <a href="#reporting-period">Reporting Period</a>. The Reporting Phase lasts twenty seven (27) days in which Markets in a <a href="#reporting-round">Reporting Round</a> are Reported on. The Dispute Phase lasts three (3) days and during this time any <a href="#rep">REP</a> holder is allowed to post a <a href="#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a> to <a href="#challenge">Challenge</a> the <a href="#proposed-outcome">Proposed Outcome</a> of the <a href="#market-awaiting-finalization">Market Awaiting Finalization</a>. Reporting Windows are occasionally referred to as &ldquo;Reporting Cycles&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reporting Periods&rdquo; as those were legacy terms for a Reporting Window during development of Augur.</p>

<h2 id="scalar-market">Scalar Market</h2>

<p>A Scalar Market is a <a href="#market">Market</a> with a range for potential <a href="#outcome">outcomes</a>. A scalar market example might be &ldquo;According to www.weather.com, what will the temperature in Fahrenheit be at SFO on January 3rd, 2062 at 1:00pm?&rdquo;. In this example market, we might set the <a href="#minimum-display-price">minDisplayPrice</a> of the market to -50 and the <a href="#maximum-display-price">maxDisplayPrice</a> to 150. This would allow for the market to <a href="#settlement">Settle</a> on any number between the two. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t need a range of potential outcomes, only a simple yes/no or a small number of choices, in these cases you would want to use a <a href="#binary-market">Binary</a> or <a href="#categorical-market">Categorical</a> Market respectively.</p>

<h2 id="settlement">Settlement</h2>

<p>Settlement is something that happens one of two ways. The first is when a trader who holds <a href="#shares">Shares</a> would like to cash out of their <a href="#position">Position</a> on a <a href="#finalized-market">Finalized Market</a>. The other is the collection of a <a href="#complete-set">Complete Set</a> which can happen before a Market Finalizes. The <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a>, which includes both the <a href="#creator-fee">Creator Fee</a> and the <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fee</a>, are only extracted during settlement.</p>

<h2 id="settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</h2>

<p>Settlement Fees are fees extracted when a <a href="#complete-set">Complete Set</a> is <a href="#settlement">Settled</a>. It&rsquo;s the combination of the <a href="#creator-fee">Creator Fee</a> and the <a href="#reporting-fee">Reporting Fee</a>.</p>

<h2 id="shares">Shares</h2>

<p>A Share is the ownership of a portion of a <a href="#market">Market&rsquo;s</a> <a href="#outcome">Outcome&rsquo;s</a> value. A <a href="#complete-set">Complete Set</a> of Shares are created when both the <a href="#order-creator">Creator</a> and <a href="#order-filler">Filler</a> of an <a href="#order">Order</a> send currency to the market to complete an <a href="#order">Order</a>. Shares are settled (destroyed) when a Complete Set is sold back to the market.</p>

<h2 id="stake-token">Stake Token</h2>

<p>A Stake Token is used to represent the amount of Staked <a href="#rep">REP</a> a <a href="#reporter">Reporter</a> has on an <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> for their <a href="#report">Report</a>. Stake Tokens have a 1:1 cost ratio to REP, so 100 <a href="#atto-prefix">attoREP</a> would buy you 100 <a href="#atto-prefix">attoStakeTokens</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tick">Tick</h2>

<p>A Tick is the smallest recognized amount by which a price of a security or future may fluctuate. Ticks are each individually a potential price point for a <a href="#shares">Share</a> of an <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> for a <a href="#market">Market</a> between its <a href="#minimum-display-price">Minimum Price</a> and <a href="#maximum-display-price">Maximum Price</a>. When a <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> creates a new Market they are asked to enter the <a href="#number-of-ticks">Number of Ticks</a> for the Market. This number represents how much <a href="#atto-prefix">attoETH</a> a <a href="#complete-set">Complete Set</a> of Shares will cost to buy for this Market. A <a href="#scalar-market">Scalar Market</a> with a Minimum Price of -10 and a Maximum Price of 30 could have a number of ticks set to 4000. This would mean that to purchase a Complete Set for this Market, you would need to spend 4000 <a href="#atto-prefix">attoETH</a>. The <a href="#settlement">Settlement</a> of a Complete Set of Shares will yield 4000 attoeth, which <a href="#settlement-fees">Settlement Fees</a> are then extracted from prior to payout. It also indicates that there are 4000 valid price points between -10 and 30 in this Market, which means an <a href="#order">Order</a> with a price of 1.24 or 20.5 is valid for this Market, but a price of 5.725 would be invalid.</p>

<h2 id="topic">Topic</h2>

<p>A Topic is a keyword used to categorize <a href="#market">markets</a>. All markets must have a topic, and are optionally allowed up to two sub-topics to further categorize the Market. An example Market for &ldquo;Will the New York Giants win Super Bowl 100?&rdquo; might have a Topic of &ldquo;Sports&rdquo; and sub-topics of &ldquo;American Football&rdquo; and &ldquo;NFL&rdquo;. The Topics are set by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> when a new market is made and cannot be changed.</p>

<h2 id="universe">Universe</h2>

<p>A Universe is a version of Augur. All <a href="#market">Markets</a> created on Augur belong to a Universe. Augur will launch with only one Universe, but more can be created in the rare event of a <a href="#fork">Fork</a>. The Universe in which a Fork occurs will become a <a href="#locked-universe">Locked Universe</a> and new Universes will be created, one for each <a href="#outcome">Outcome</a> of the <a href="#forked-market">Forked Market</a>. After a Fork, <a href="#rep">REP</a> holders can choose to migrate their REP to one of the new Universes created. They don&rsquo;t have to migrate, but Locked Universes do not allow the creation of new Markets, and therefor there will be no Markets to <a href="#report">Report</a> on in the future and no fees to earn from Reporting. All Universes of Augur are equally valid, even after a Fork has been resolved, and can continue to operate after the <a href="#fork-period">Fork Period</a> ends. Universes contain only the Forked Market with a <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> set to one of the possible outcomes, with a Universe created for each possibility, and no other Markets to begin with.</p>

<h2 id="validity-bond">Validity Bond</h2>

<p>The Validity Bond is paid by the <a href="#market-creator">Market Creator</a> during Market Creation. The bond is paid in ETH and is refunded to the Market Creator if the <a href="#final-outcome">Final Outcome</a> of the <a href="#market">Market</a> is not invalid.</p>
